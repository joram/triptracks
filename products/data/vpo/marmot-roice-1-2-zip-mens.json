  "description": "Throw on this comfy square-quilted pullover with any casual or trail-ready outfit on any cool-weather outing to the ballgame or the state park. It's there for you to pull over your tee or flannel when you need an extra layer for mornings at the farmers market or evenings by the campfire. Active-lifestyle-approved fabric is super soft and dries quickly, so you'll stay comfy racing home on 2 wheels when the rain starts falling or hopping rocks that are a little bigger than you anticipated.",
