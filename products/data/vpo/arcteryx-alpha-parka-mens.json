  "description": "Winter belays are unforgiving. The Alpha Parka - their warmest down-insulated belay parka - sheds the cold and wind so you can focus on your task. RDS-certified 850-fill goose down\u2019s outstanding warmth is complemented with mapped synthetic insulation for added breathability in moisture-prone areas. Exceptionally breathable 2L GORE-TEX INFINIUM\u2122 with ultralight, ultra-durable Hadron\u2122 face fabric blocks wind and resists water while adding warmth equivalent to 100g of down. A proprietary fabric we created to redefine the standard for superlight alpine durability, Hadron\u2122 is engineered with a liquid crystal polymer ripstop grid to deliver abrasion resistance rivaling fabrics twice its weight. A StormHood\u2122 protects without impacting lines-of-sight, and the articulated gender-specific design fits comfortably over winter climbing gear.",
