  "description": "The new all mountain long socks warm for men keep your feet warm during demanding ski tour ascents and speedy descents on powdery snow.<br>Particularly fine merino wool at 21.5 microns in thickness feels pleasant on the skin and makes these long ski touring socks elastic and stable. The natural properties of merino wool really come into their own in socks, naturally regulating the temperature and moisture while also neutralizing unpleasant odors.<br>The circular-knitted all mountain long socks warm for men are designed to fit perfectly without any irritating seams, thus reducing areas that rub or dig in. Made for extremely cold days, the warm version of the all mountain socks are fully lined with sculptured terry-lining, a special knitted construction that optimally traps heat and creates the perfect climate with air pockets.<br>The ankle and arch support ensures a good fit and prevents the ski touring socks from slipping or creasing. You can also say goodbye to blisters in the toe area in future thanks to the flat toe seam.<br>The all mountain long socks warm for men are thus the perfect companion for demanding ski tours on cold days.",
