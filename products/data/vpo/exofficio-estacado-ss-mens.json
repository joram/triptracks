  "description": "The Men's Estacado Short-Sleeve Shirt is designed with the adventurer in mind, combining the style you want and the performance you need. A mesh-lined, vented back yoke keeps you cool in the most punishing heat, and a UPF-50 rating protects from harmful UV rays, meaning longer hikes or more time fishing at your favorite spot. A utility loop above the front left pocket can be used to keep your rod securely fastened or your sunglasses within reach. The mesh-lined chest pockets feature embroidered drain holes. The left drop-in pocket features a VELCRO\u00ae closure, while the right one is zippered. A chamois patch is located inside the bottom-left placket, so you can keep your sunglasses clean and eyes on the prize.",
