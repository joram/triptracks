  "description": "The Cubit Stretch Down Smock is a modern, more sustainable twist on a traditional style. Giving a second life to quality down that might have otherwise ended up in landfill, the Cubit Stretch Down Smock is filled with the 700FP P.U.R.E recycled down.<br><br>It features innovative Pertex\u00ae3D Weave Technology, which allows the baffles to be woven from a single length of stretch fabric without any stitching. This improves down lofting, increases wind resistance, reduces weight, and allows the material to flex and stretch as you move. The Pertex\u00ae Quantum outer fabric is wind and weather resistant, and with a fluorocarbon free DWR finish it protects from wild winter weather.<br><br>Perfect for everyday at the crag or an evening by the campfire, the Cubit Stretch Down Smock has a cosy down filled hood and slim fit for that extra snug feel in freezing temperatures. It has two useful zipped hand pockets and a fleece lined chin guard with durable YKK\u00ae VISLON\u00ae half zip for quick ventilation or locked in warmth.",
