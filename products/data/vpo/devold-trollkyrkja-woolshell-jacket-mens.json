  "description": "There is always a natural alternative, and therefore they have designed a wool shell jacket and bib pant in 100% merino wool, made especially for ski touring. The Devold\u00ae Trollkyrkja collection is a wind- and water-resistant outer layer developed for high-intensity activities where the need for insulation and the ability to regulate body temperature are important. The innovative Merino fabric, called MerinoPerform\u2122 WP, is a high-performance fabric based on the latest fibre stretching technology, providing great freedom of movement. In addition to smart venting options, the wool material itself will transport moisture away from the body and keep you warm even in wet conditions. Sealed seams and water-repellent zips ensure wind- and water-resistant performance. The Trollkyrkja jacket has an active fit with articulated elbows, and a high collar with helmet-compatible hood. The bib pant is designed with an extended back and front panel, articulated seat construction, shaped knees and smart venting options. - Helmet-compatible hood. - Soft chin guard. - 2-way water-repellent front YKK\u2122 zipper. - Vertical chest pocket. - Ventilation under the arms. - Shaped elbows. - Asymmetrical sleeve end with velcro tightening. - One-handed tightening at waist. - Extended backdrop.",
