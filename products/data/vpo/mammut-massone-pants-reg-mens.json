  "description": "The casual Massone Pants know what climbers want: Robust fabric, absolute freedom of movement and pockets that won't spill, even when you're upside-down. One of the five pockets is zippered at the thigh so that you can easily reach it while wearing a harness. The drawcords can be placed inwards or outwards thanks to eyelets on both sides. These pants are made from a viscose-polyester mix that is as cosy as cotton and as stretchy as spandex. Allez!",
