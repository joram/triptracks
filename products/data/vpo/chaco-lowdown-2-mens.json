  "description": "Lock into the Lowdown 2 Sandal from Chaco. Built for travel and life on the go, these lightweight sport sandals are slimmer-profile and nearer to ground for a natural underfoot feel. The upbound-EVA construction offers high rebound that won\u2019t easily compress with wear, and thoughtful exclusion of all animal products mean they\u2019re vegan as well. Engineered with Chaco\u2019s contoured LUVSEAT\u2122 arch-support that promotes healthy alignment, the corrective footbeds are accepted by the APMA (American Podiatric Medical Association) and feel fantastic on foot or after long runs, hikes, and workouts. <br><br>Perfect for globe-trotting travel, vacations, or just time spent outdoors or in the water. Featuring Chaco\u2019s iconic Z/Strap adjustment with cinch buckle, a toe loop for additional forefoot security, a heel strap, and unique adjustment through the heel riser.",
