  "description": "Seriously versatile, the Kyanite is the one you grab for climbs, ski days, cold hikes, and to cut the chill when you roll out of bed. Worn as a midlayer or standalone, it delivers warmth, mobility, and moisture management. The Polartec\u00ae Power Stretch\u00ae Pro has a nylon face for abrasion resistance, and four-way stretch for freedom of movement. The streamlined fit delivers unrestricted comfort and layers easily under a shell, and a low-profile hood adds warmth.",
