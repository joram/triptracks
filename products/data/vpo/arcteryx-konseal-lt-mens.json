  "description": "Leveraging advanced technologies, lighter \u2013 but reliably durable \u2013 materials, and a highly focused design process, we created their lightest approach shoe, the Konseal LT. Built to cover rugged ground while you\u2019re carrying a pack and climbing gear, it delivers underfoot support and protection, agility to handle shifting terrain, and the confident grip of a Vibram\u00ae Megagrip outsole. The inner provides barefoot comfort, and the heel folds flat so you can wear it as a clog while belaying or at camp.",
