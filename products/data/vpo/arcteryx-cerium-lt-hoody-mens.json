  "description": "Streamlined in its design, and with an exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio, the Cerium LT hoody works as a mid layer or a standalone piece in cool, dry conditions. Premium 850 fill-power down is lofty and resilient, the Arato\u2122 10 nylon shell provides lightweight durability, and Down Composite Mapping\u2122 strategically places Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation in moisture-prone areas. Articulated construction moves with the body, and the insulated StormHood\u2122 provides coverage without compromising range of vision.",
