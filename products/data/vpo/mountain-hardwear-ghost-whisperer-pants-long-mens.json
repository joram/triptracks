  "description": "A sustainable reimagining of Mountain Hardwear's best-selling ultralight down jacket, the Ghost Whisperer\u2122 Pants layer effectively under ski pants, perform efficiently while warming up at the boulders, and even pack into its own pocket after you take them off. Because something's off if your belayer's shivering like they've got Elvis leg. Why put all the focus on layering around your core yet miss an opportunity to lock in heat around the lower half of your body? This is Mountain Hardwear's solution.",
