  "description": "Lots of function, little weight: The Piz Selva Pants for men are preferred on hot summer days on lonely, alpine peaks. <br><br>With their loose cut and pre-regulated leg cuffs, these lightweight mountain pants effortlessly follow your every move. At the same time, the 4-way stretch material and the pre-shaped knee area ensure maximum freedom of movement in any terrain. When scrambling in short rock passages, the Merino Shield Ultra Light material ensures high abrasion resistance and protects against damage. Short rain showers survives the quick-drying pants thanks to PFC-free DWR treatment without grumbling. Tasmanian merino wool is used in the elastic waistband, which feels pleasant on the skin and at the same time has a moisture-regulating effect.<br><br>All this makes the casual Piz Selva Pants&nbsp; for men the perfect companion to reach the summit even on hot summer days loose and easy.",
