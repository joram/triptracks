  "description": "This classic cable knit sweater is named after Kvitholmen fyr, which is situated on the coast of Nordm\u00f8re. The weather can be quite challenging here, even in Summer, and that is why they found this warm, soft sweater to fit the place perfectly. A good cable knit sweater brings back childhood memories of my grandfather's wooden boat, and a sweater he used to wear with a captain's hat. He smoked tobacco from a wooden pipe too. Yes, the stereotypical fisherman did exist. For them, there is such great comfort in a cozy cable knitted sweater that you can put on during chill Summer nights, while sitting by the camp fire. Of course, their version is made of one of their favorite yarns from the Italian mill, Linsieme. Its a yarn made of extra fine Merino wool and Cashmere.",
