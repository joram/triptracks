  "description": "Classic materials make up this jacket in quilted G-1000 that is insulated with recovered Swedish wool. Wool has warmed outdoor hearts for generations and here we are making use of wool that would otherwise be thrown away. The jacket has two-way hand pockets and the collar can be folded up and secured in place to keep your neck warm. A timeless favourite that blends in just as well in the city as for weekend forest walks",
