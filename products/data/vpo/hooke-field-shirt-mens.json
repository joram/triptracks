  "description": "Hook\u00e9's field shirt lives up to its name! Versatile and multifunctional, it will protect you from the sun without trapping heat, since the back is ventilated with a mesh lining.<br><br>Made of 90% nylon and 10% spandex, it dries very quickly when wet and its fabric is slightly stretchy to ensure better fluidity of movement in the flex zones. It is the perfect shirt to combine comfort and practicality. <br><br>This shirt is reinforced under the forearms and lower back, areas that need it the most for outdoor use, which will give you more durability. Adjustable at the sleeves when rolled up and at the cuffs when unrolled, the shirt also has an accessory loop that allows you to hang your wire cutter or other small tools or accessories. A microfiber cleaning cloth specially designed for sunglasses and lenses is also directly integrated into the shirt!<br><br>With a small quick access pocket and two chest pockets, one zippered and one with a flap, you'll have all the space you need to go on an adventure in an organized manner while being self-sufficient without clutter once you're in the field.",
