  "description": "Built to provide support and protection every step of the way, the Mission Leather Low WP is a durable, waterproof approach shoe that can handle season after season of mountain treks. Featuring a waterproof/breathable BD.dry lining combined with a high-grade Nubuck leather upper, this shoe keeps you dry while moving through stream crossings or snow fields. The climbing forefoot and toecap construction, which features their BlackLabel-Mountain sticky rubber adds precision when the trail kicks up into a scramble. Deep, high traction lugs provide grip in mud, and the fully gusseted tongue is padded for maximum comfort while keeping dirt and debris out. A tuned EVA midsole provides ample stiffness and precision when aiding through vertical terrain or Via Ferratas, and multiple webbing loops give you tagging options when the approach ends and the climbing begins.",
