  "description": "Patagonia's roots are in Yvon Chouinard\u2019s blacksmith shop where he forged pitons that made Yosemite big-wall climbing possible\u2014the Forge Mark graphic is a nod to Chouinard's hammered signature. Pitons proved destructive to rock, but they remind us of who we once were and why we're in business to save our home planet. Conserving resources helps, so this T-shirt is made with recycled fabrics. By utilizing fabric scraps and recycled bottles, we reduce our reliance on virgin raw materials. Made in a Fair Trade Certified\u2122 factory.",
