  "description": "A super-sporty and agile hiking shoe for multi-day outings, trekking excursions or fast-paced hikes in the mountains, incorporating the benefits of cutting-edge production techniques. The core of the Ducan High GTX\u00ae Men is the Mammut Flextron technology which integrates a spring-steel sole as a midsole in the shoe. This prevents deflection of the foot while at the same time providing improved vertical support. The result: more efficient use of energy on hikes and climbs. Mammut Georganic 3D technology ensures natural movement of the foot. The geometric-dynamic design is combined with cuts tailored organically to the foot. The focal point is the anatomical last which, together with the asymmetric lacing and mono-tongue for one-sided entry, provides a very good fit. With the specially designed vibram\u00ae sole, the Ducan High GTX\u00ae Men will bring you outstanding grip on uneven terrain in the world of nature and the mountains.",
