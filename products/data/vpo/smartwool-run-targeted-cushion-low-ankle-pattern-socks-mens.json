Instead, start with the footwear that will put as much comfort as possible into your run, like our Run Targeted Cushion Low Ankle Pattern Socks. They start with cushion on the places that feel the impact the most\u2014the ball and heel of the foot\u2014and add in other feel-good features like mesh zones for breathability, a Virtually Seamless\u2122 toe, and an Achilles tab to prevent slippage. Plus, because they\u2019re made with responsibly sourced Merino wool, they\u2019re naturally odor-resistant and temperature-regulating. And, with Indestructawool\u2122 technology, they\u2019re built to last.",
