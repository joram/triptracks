In warm weather, the legs can be zipped off to transform the trousers into a pair of shorts. The removed section has a drawcord at the calf that together with the boot hook transforms it into a gaiter that protects legs in brush-filled terrain. Made in stretch fabric and G-1000 Eco for freedom of movement, protection and durability.",
