  "description": "Born from the same commitment to performance as their alpine designs, then upstyled for urban life, the Radsten Parka delivers outstanding warmth and weather protection. The 2L Gore-Tex fabric has a soft hand, melange look, and provides proven waterproof, windproof, breathable performance. Coreloft\u2122 Compact synthetic insulation warms without bulk, and laser cut underarm vents regulate comfort as temperatures shift. The insulated hood adds warmth and protection, and gaskets at the cuffs and hood seal out drafts.",
