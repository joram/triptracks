  "description": "Adding all-conditions versatility to the best all-around mountain show we offer, the Rapid GTX offers nearly unlimited possibilities. This hybrid shoe is equally adept at ticking off trail miles, boulder hopping and scrambling moderate slabs. The all-synthetic upper is lightweight and protective, and is backed by a GORE-TEX\u00ae Invisible Fit lining for waterproof protection. <br><br>The dual-density EVA midsole delivers a ride more akin to a trail running shoe, but they have added a TPU arch insert for torsion control, and their Dynamic Protection System insert in the forefoot for increased protection, propulsion and edging capability. <br><br>The Vibram\u00ae outsole features high-friction Megagrip rubber, and an edging zone under the big toe for unbeatable friction and traction. Snow underfoot? Sloppy trails/ No problem - the Rapid GTX is the perfect choice for moving fast over mixed mountain terrain in variable conditions.",
