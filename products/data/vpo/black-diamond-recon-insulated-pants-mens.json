  "description": "Built for riders and skiers who desire extra warmth for missions both in-bounds and out, the Recon Stretch Insulated Pants are coming in hot. Lined with zoned insulation, these pants are breathable and mobile where you need it, while providing added warmth for the rest of your lower body. Featuring 4-way stretch fabric, this pant moves with you on big tours in the mountains, while the Recon\u2019s BD.dry\u2122 waterproof/breathable solution keeps you dry on deep turns and storm days. An integrated RECCO reflector adds to the pants\u2019 snow safety capabilities, while the instep patches guard against ski edges and crampon points. The Recon\u2019s offset side vents allow you to dump heat on the skin track, and the high mounted snow gaiter keeps out the snow.",
