  "description": "<p>With an athletic design focusing on fit and fabric performance,  the Motus is an advanced performance top for trail running. Soft and lightweight,  the Phasic\u2122 FL bi-component fabric delivers exceptional moisture management. The anatomical patterning,  trim fit and fabric\u2019s stretch help the Motus move with the body and keep the fibres close to the skin to maximize wicking performance. Seams are minimized to reduce potential irritation,  and reflective blades increase visibility in low light.</p><p>Updated with a revised fit.</p><p>Crafted at a Fair Trade Certified facility as part of our commitment to transition 80% of Arc\u2019teryx products to fair trade certification by 2025.</p>",
