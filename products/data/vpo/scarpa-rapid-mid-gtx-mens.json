  "description": "Adding increased ankle support to the best all-around mountain show we offer, the new Rapid Mid GTX offers nearly unlimited possibilities and all-conditions versatility. This hybrid shoe is equally adept at ticking off trail miles, boulder hopping and scrambling moderate slabs. The all-synthetic upper is lightweight, protective, and is backed by a GORE-TEX\u00ae Invisible Fit lining for waterproof protection. <br><br>The dual-density EVA midsole delivers a ride more akin to a trail running shoe, but we have added a TPU arch insert for torsion control, and our Dynamic Protection System insert in the forefoot for increased protection, propulsion and edging capability. The Vibram\u00ae outsole features high-friction Megagrip rubber, and an edging zone under the big toe for unbeatable friction and traction. Snow underfoot? Sloppy trails/ No problem - the Rapid Mid GTX is the perfect choice for moving fast over mixed mountain terrain in variable conditions.",
