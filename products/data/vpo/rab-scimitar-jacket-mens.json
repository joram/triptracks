  "description": "The Scimitar is a midweight softshell that balances warmth, protection, and mobility. Ideal as an outer layer in fast changing weather or paired with a hardshell if you\u2019re expecting heavy precipitation, it offers wind resistance and exceptional breathability. Finished with a fluorocarbon-free DWR, it sheds light rain and snow, so you can worry less about changing layers and press on in changeable weather.<br><br>The soft, brushed-backed Matrix\u2122 fabric is quick wicking, fast drying and self-regulating, keeping you comfortable when intensity peaks. Reinforcements in high wear areas cope well with rock abrasion and the repetitive pressure of pack straps. Stretchy throughout, it gives you complete freedom to move while negotiating steeper slopes. Seal out the chill with adjustable cuffs and a protective hood, designed to keep the wind off and maintain your visibility with a stiff peak and easy head movement. Whether you\u2019re wielding a walking axe or striding out with poles, the Scimitar is a versatile layer that will keep you comfortable in a variety of conditions.",
