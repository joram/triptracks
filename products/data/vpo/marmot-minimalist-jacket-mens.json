  "description": "When the forecast isn't optimal but you're still ready to get out there, wear the lightweight, compressible Men's Minimalist Jacket. Perfect for your next rainy outdoor adventure, it features GORE-TEX\u00ae Paclite\u00ae technology, which offers a wind-blocking hydrophobic membrane and weight-minimizing comfort. 100% seam taping, a DWR (Durable Water-Repellent) finish, an attached adjustable hood, and a bonded flap over the center front zipper increase the weather protection of this rain jacket. Heat-releasing PitZips improve airflow and help regulate body temperature, while articulated elbows increase mobility on the trail. If the temps drop, zip it up over an insulated jacket for extra warmth.",
