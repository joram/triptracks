  "description": "Devold\u00ae Running Outer Layer consists of jackets, vests, skirts, shorts, calves and sleeves. All layers are compatible and can easily be removed while running. The collection is the ultimate range of training garments for trail running, offering protection from changing weather conditions. The garments are fast-drying, super lightweight and breathable products made from Merino wool. The most important benefit of wearing wool while exercising is that wool is naturally odour-resistant and thermo-regulating, and keeps your skin dry when you start to sweat.",
