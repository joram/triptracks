  "description": "Complete your backcountry kit with the Men\u2019s Smokes Run Jacket. Paired with 100% seam taping, its waterproof, windproof, and extremely breathable 3-layer GORE-TEX\u00ae Pro fabric offers superior weather protection, plus prevents overheating when your adventure gets intense. Get some air using the underarm PitZips and water-resistant zipper with a two-way design. The fixed helmet-compatible hood stays in place, while a zip-off powder skirt prevents snow from reaching your inner layers. The RECCO\u00ae Avalanche Rescue Reflector bounces a signal back to rescuers for added safety in harsh conditions. Stow ski gear in one of many zippered pockets.",
