  "description": "Bike to work, running for the train, stairs instead of elevator \u2013 the city makes you move. The A2B Polo is made to go with you. The Polylain\u2122 fabric \u2013 a knit blending responsibly-sourced Merino wool with polyester fibres \u2013 feels great on, stays comfortable across a range of temperatures, helps manage moisture, and naturally resists odour. And the design goes way beyond nine-to-five with a hidden snap placket and trim fit that give it a contemporary style that steps above traditional. <br><br>Updated with a revised trim fit and restyled collar.",
