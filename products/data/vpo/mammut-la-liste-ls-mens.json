  "description": "The long-sleeve shirt from the \u201cLa Liste\u201d collection features the typical colors of the special edition accompanied by a large MAMMUT print on the sleeve. It\u2019s not just its looks that are impressive: the slightly stronger GOTS-certified organic cotton material feels pleasant on the skin and makes sure you don\u2019t overheat or feel too cold when out freeriding or in everyday life. A comfortable long-sleeve for daily wear. Made in Europe. The film \u201cLa Liste \u2013 Everything or Nothing\u201d documents the project conceived by MAMMUT Pro Team Athlete J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Heitz, in which he skis the most spectacular 6,000 meter peaks in an unprecedented new style. This sequel to the sensational first film has once again been produced in partnership with Mammut.",
