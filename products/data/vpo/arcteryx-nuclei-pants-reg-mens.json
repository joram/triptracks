  "description": "Light, packable, and built for belays, or anyplace exposed to biting cold, the Nuclei provides warmth that frees you to focus on your task. 80g Coreloft\u2122 Continuous insulation goes from waist to knee, with 60g at the lower leg to balance appropriate warmth and light weight. The light, tough Arato 15 fabric blocks wind, and Gore-Tex reinforces the seat and knees. Full separating side zips make on-and-off easy - even on hanging belays - and an accessible thigh pocket doubles as a stuff sack.",
