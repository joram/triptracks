  "description": "Summer, sun, sunshine - on long mountain tours in summer temperatures, the Alpine Low for men can not be missing. The robust material mix with climate-regulating and odor-inhibiting merino wool is equipped with a circumferential mesh system, which ensures optimal ventilation. So that the foot is not only well ventilated, but also protected in the best possible way, material reinforcements in sensitive areas provide additional cushioning and protect against abrasion. Thanks to comfort waistband, ergonomic right / left fit and a special stabilization zone around the ankle, annoying slipping of the footies is a thing of the past. The soft and supple material prevents wrinkles and, together with the flat seams, prevents unpleasant blisters and pressure points. This makes the&nbsp;Alpine Low Socks&nbsp;the perfect companion for extended hikes on hot summer days.",
