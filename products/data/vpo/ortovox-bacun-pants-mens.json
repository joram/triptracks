  "description": "<p>They have improved their Merino Naturetec line down to the finest detail for the new ski touring season! The material used in their Bacun Pants for men is now even more stable yet provides the same freedom of movement. <br><br>Of course, the functional design of the fabric remains exactly the same: The finest merino fibers on the inside are interwoven with a protective polyamide shell. Thus they achieve outstanding breathability without a membrane, while the material\u2019s tight weave is still extremely wind and water-resistant. On the inside, merino fibers provide perfect moisture and temperature regulation. The natural fibers wick up moisture, transporting them to the fiber cores and then outwards so that the surface stays dry and comfortable on the skin.<br><br>Features such as the adjustable waistband and elastic ankle cuffs, which are very quick to adjust, guarantee that these ski touring pants for men fit perfectly. Reworked merino mesh inserts in the waistband provide extra comfort. What\u2019s more, our Bacun Pants for men have a slightly higher waist to protect your back from the snow and the cold. Integrated gaiters, which are coated with silicone on the inside of the ankle cuffs, also protect against snow. The thigh pocket has more than enough room for your avalanche transceiver, and the integrated light carabiner will prevent it getting lost. Other small items that are required quickly can be stowed away in one of the hip pockets. And in case it gets a bit more challenging: the side zippers will cool you down on sweat-inducing ascents!</p>",
