  "description": "Athletic mountain activities despite the heat:&nbsp;their 120 Cool Tec Clean tee for men makes this possible and completes our line of cooling clothing for warm days. The 120 Cool Tec clean t-shirt for men embodies pure functionality, because the combination of fine merino fibers and botanical tencel\u00ae cellulose fibers is self-cooling, tough and durable thanks to corespun technology this is due to a complicated process in which the fine merino and Tencel\u2122 fibers are spun around a core of polyamide filaments. The resulting yarn is used to produce a material that has the same benefits as merino wool and Tencel\u2122, and is even more robust. With a fiber diameter of just 17.5 microns, the merino wool feels particularly soft on the skin. Their 120 Cool Tec Clean&nbsp;tee for men is thus ideal for athletic mountain activities on hot days. 120 Merino Cool Tec is a cooling combination of merino wool and Tencel\u2122 fibers (obtained from cellulose fibers of botanic origin). In a complex process, the fine merino and Tencel\u2122 fibers are spun around a core of polyamide filaments. This makes the fabric robust without sacrificing the benefits of merino wool and Tencel\u2122.",
