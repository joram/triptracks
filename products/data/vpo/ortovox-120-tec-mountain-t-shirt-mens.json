  "description": "Light and elastic but robust: Thanks to its durable merino yarn and mountain print, their 120 TEC MOUNTAIN T-SHIRT for men is ready for steep walls and rugged summits.<br><br>A special yarn construction in which Tasmanian merino fibers are spun around a polyamide filament core ensures the necessary stability and scuff protection. This makes the fabric light but extremely robust without sacrificing the benefits of merino wool. Virgin wool is naturally temperature and moisture regulating as well as odor neutralizing. In addition, at just 17.5 microns fiber diameter, the fine merino wool is soft on the skin and extraordinarily comfortable.<br><br>The anatomic cut of our 120 TEC MOUNTAIN T-SHIRT for men will provide maximum freedom of movement no matter how demanding your activity is. This casual T-shirt will not only cut a fine figure while climbing: The cool colors and subtle print make this climbing shirt suitable for everyday wear too.<br><br>Our 120 TEC MOUNTAIN T-SHIRT for men is therefore perfect for your alpine summer.<br>",
