  "description": "The Brenner Pro Wide GTX is a robust, yet flexible trekking boot with a particularly high and stable upper. This provides additional protection in rugged terrain, in high grass and undergrowth \u2013 or in wet weather together in combination with its waterproof GORE-TEX lining. Its upper consists of high-quality nubuck. <br><br>This terracare\u00ae leather from the Josef Heinen leather factory is a first-class, long-lasting material made with the lowest possible impact on people or the environment. The ball bearing lacing system ensures a smooth action, while the flex zone at the heel provides additional flexibility. Made over a Wide Last, this boot offers good heel retention, but has more space at the forefoot and ball of the foot. <br><br>Their Wide models are for people who find standard models too narrow at the front. The Vibram Endurance Pro sole delivers a wide ground contact area at the heel for good stability on longer treks. And the rounded tread lugs in the middle of sole and rounded rubber sole edges mean that the self-cleaning tread keeps your boots working through the muddiest terrain. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion.",
