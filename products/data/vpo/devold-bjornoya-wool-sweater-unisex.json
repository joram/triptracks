  "description": "The Devold\u00ae Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya Sweater is inspired by one of Devold\u2019s most popular sweaters, the Svalbard. While the original is extra thick and insulating, the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya sweater is made from 100% pure new wool, which makes it super-soft, lightweight and more versatile for everyday adventures. The old pattern, originally designed by the Italian designer Olmes Caretti, covers only the top part of the sweater, giving it a more minimalistic and contemporary look. Classic flat-knit sweater in two colours. Comfortable ribbed bottom of the sleeves and body.",
