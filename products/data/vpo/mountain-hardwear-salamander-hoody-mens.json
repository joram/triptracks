  "description": "An ode to the curious creatures inhabiting our home-state's hinterland, this tee reps the Gabilan slender salamander of Pinnacles National Park. The perfect pair for long hours on the road dogging Bay Area traffic, days in desolation surrounded by towering oaks, and year-round sends on its famous chossy run-outs; it brings this amphibian's playful nature into climbs and explorations of all kinds.",
