  "description": "Their product line Faerder is named after the Faerder lighthouse, situated at the beginning of the Oslo fjord. This is also where the worlds biggest \"over-night\" regatta takes place every year,since 1947, the second weekend in the month of June. It is arranged by the Royal Norwegian Sailing Association. Usually, between 600-700 boats are in the race. A good fleece garment is always a must to bring on a sail boat, and our vest is made from a lovely, brushed Merino. It has a zipper in front, as well as zipped front pockets. The chest pocket in front is made of water repellent fabric, and is closed with a zipper.",
