  "description": "Offering the durability of Norrona's classic svalbard heavy duty in an even more protective design, the svalbard heavy duty bib is their most rugged pants for general outdoor activities. They're made to withstand heavy activity and harsh conditions all year and are full of functionality perfectly customized for the outdoors. <br><br>The design is based on the classic heavy-duty, but a bit wider from the thigh and up to make a clean, functional transition to the bib. While a waistline with belt loops, adjustment and reinforcements can make this area crowded and unpractical with a backpack, they've made it as clean as possible. The pants are made in a mix of long-lasting, natural cotton canvas and recycled polyester which is highly durable and breathable. <br><br>The ?flexible and water-resistant fabric used in the seat and knees ensures extra flexibility and protection. Practical features include side venting, back pockets, front pockets, hidden gaiter hook, and laminated zippers. The bib has three extra pockets and the lower legs are adjustable to perfectly customize the fit.",
