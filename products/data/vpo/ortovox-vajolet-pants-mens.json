  "description": "Lightweight products can also be robust: the vajolet pants combine both lightness with scuff resistance and are at home on steep rock faces. The merino shield ultra light line\u2019s thin, elastic main material guarantees the necessary freedom of movement \u2013 for use during any demanding climb. Inserts made of scuff-resistant material also protect from rugged rock. We use a tasmanian merino wool elastic for the adjustable waistband, ensuring optimum temperature and moisture regulation. These lightweight climbing pants are also pfc-free in the interest of sustainability. Other features such as the map pocket on the thigh or the pre-adjusted cuffs make our vajolet pants the perfect alpine companions \u2013 on the bizarre rock formations of the dolomite\u2019s vajolet towers as well as on the steep rock faces of the wilder kaiser.",
