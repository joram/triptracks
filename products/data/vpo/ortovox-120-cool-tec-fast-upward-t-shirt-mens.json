  "description": "Fast forward, fast upward: with the 120 merino cool tec line, you\u2019ll be prepared for any heights. The sporty fast upward t-shirt for men complements our line for warm days. A slightly longer fit ensures the shirt sits optimally during intense activity. In addition, the fine raglan seam prevents chafing when wearing backpacks. <br>the material mix in our fast upward t-shirt stands for pure functionality: the combination of fine merino fibers and tenceltm cellulose fibers of botanic origin is self-cooling, tough and durable thanks to corespun technology. This is due to a complicated process in which the fine merino and tenceltm fibers are spun around a core of polyamide filaments. The resulting yarn is used to produce a material that has the same benefits as merino wool and tenceltm, and is even more robust.",
