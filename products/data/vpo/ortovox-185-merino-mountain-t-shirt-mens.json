  "description": "The 185 Merino Mountain T-Shirt for men is made of 100% pure merino wool with a fineness of 19 microns. It feels comfortable on the skin and ensures an optimum climate thanks to its temperature and moisture-regulating qualities. As always, this merino wool comes from selected Tasmanian farms where our sheep can enjoy an almost boundless habitat in a moderate climate. These optimum living conditions result in the high quality and functionality of the fine wool.",
