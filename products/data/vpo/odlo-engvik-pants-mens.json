  "description": "Engvik - a small coastal town on Norway's west coast - is no stranger to harsh winters. For this town and for these conditions, we crafted these beautifully functional XC pants - a windproof, warm, lightweight and breathable layer that are rich in features and freedom to skate and ski in whichever direction you choose. Calf zippers and two zippered hand pockets add to the pants' functionality. A lightweight layer made for exceptional days on skis.",
