  "description": "The DFS Rock collection uses a ground breaking Dual Fit System (\u201cDFS\u201d) to give you both maximum comfort during your approach and high performance fit while climbing and scrambling. The Rock DFS has two separate lace zones that utilize lightweight webbing that wraps around and under your foot which enables you to customize your shoe for the fit you want. The Rock DFS midsole incorporates a lightweight EVA foam for cushioning and a polyurethane heel for durability and support. <br><br>The midsole is then wrapped with sticky climbing rubber to protect your shoe and to provide extra grip. Together with a Vibram Approcciosa sole with Megagrip, the resulting Rock DFS offers a high-performance approach shoe for all day comfort.<br><br><BR.<br>To get the appropriate fit for the best performance they recommend ordering a 1/2 size smaller from your normal AKU boot size.",
