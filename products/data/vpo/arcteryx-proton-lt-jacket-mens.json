  "description": "The Proton LT Jacket is equipped with a breathable insulation package to manage the dynamic needs of mountain pursuits and perform as a self-regulating mid layer for a variety of high output activities. Breathable insulation means excess heat and moisture can pass through the combination of air permeable fabrics and insulation. In addition to being extremely air permeable, the Fortius\u2122 Air 20 face fabric has unrivaled hardwearing durability, over 60 times more durable in abrasion tests than the industry standard. Coreloft\u2122 Compact 80 synthetic insulation maintains excellent stretch recovery. The No Slip Zip\u2122 keeps the main zipper from self-opening. Put it on, leave it on and stay focused on the activity.",
