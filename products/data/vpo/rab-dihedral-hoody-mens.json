Highly efficient when you start to push it, this grid backed fleece regulates your temperature and wicks moisture away. It has a refined, articulated sleeve design with an underarm gusset for improved arm lift and has been designed to have a slight rise at the sides to allow for unrestricted leg movement. The cuffs and hem have a lightly elasticated binding that keeps it in place and protects from the wind.<br><br>Built with a deep kangaroo-style pocket for plunging cold hands between climbs and a form fitting hood, designed to stay up without adjustment. The ? centre front zip allows for easy pull-on or off, or for dumping heat when the sun hits the rock.<br><br>The Dihedral Hoody has a casual style for everyday use, but it really excels on the wall. Ideal as part of a layering system, for warming up on cool mornings, or for pulling on at the end of a summer day on the rock.",
