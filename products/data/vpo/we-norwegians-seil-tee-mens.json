  "description": "The Seil product line is made of a Merino/Tencel yarn, knitted in dyed stripes. TENCEL is branded lyocell and modal fiber that is produced by environmentally responsible processes from the sustainably sourced natural raw material wood. Mixed with fine Merino, it makes the fiber stronger, while maintaining the breathability of wool. The Seil Tee for men is classic fit, with a chest pocket, trimmed with our polished metal, logo rivet. We have made this t-shirts in several different color combinations, so you can pick your favorite. Wear it with the Lista shorts for a complete look.",
