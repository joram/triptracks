  "description": "Craggy terrain, steep rock faces: With high-quality materials, an ergonomic fit and functional details, the&nbsp;Casale Shorts&nbsp;for men are perfectly tailored to climbing. The casual corduroy fabric with sustainably grown hemp and organic cotton is especially comfortable, while a small proportion of elastane ensures full freedom of movement. The Casale Shorts for women are also equipped with elastic, extremely scuff-resistant Merino Shield Tec material in especially high-stress areas, while fine merino wool on the inside ensures a good microclimate. Thanks to a fabric insert in the crotch area, these robust climbing shorts will move with your every athletic maneuver. The higher cut of the elastic waistband means that, the back area always remains well protected, even under a climbing harness. The concealed zipper pocket on the thigh is positioned so that it\u2019s always easy to access, even with a climbing harness. With neon inserts and a casual fit, the Casale Shorts for men always make a great visual impression, whether you\u2019re high up on the rock face or training on a climbing wall.",
