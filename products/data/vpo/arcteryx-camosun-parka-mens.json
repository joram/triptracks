Down Contour Construction\u2122 allows the down to form to the body, enhancing thermal performance with a trimmer, more streamlined fit. Down Composite Mapping\u2122 effectively places down and synthetic insulations where they deliver the most benefit. Lofty 750 fill power European goose down lines the core and sleeves where loft is most needed. Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation is used at the cuffs, hood and under the arms, areas prone to contact with moisture. The removable hood utilizes Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation for added protection and warmth",
