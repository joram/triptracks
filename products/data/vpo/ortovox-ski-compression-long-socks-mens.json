  "description": "The&nbsp;Ski Compression Long Socks&nbsp;for men are ideal for demanding days spent on your skis and, thanks to their slight compression, ensure you can enjoy skiing for longer.<br><br>The slight compression gently distributes the pressure over the ankles and calves and effectively prevents premature fatigue in the muscles. During ascent, but also during descent, our calf muscles have to absorb numerous knocks and vibrations. The muscles are placed under continuous stress and can quickly fatigue. Balanced compression can slow this effect.<br><br>The ergonomic left and right shaping as well as the elastic double cuff and special ankle-stabilizing zone prevent the socks slipping and ensure the perfect fit. What\u2019s more, flat toe seams prevent chafing and blisters. Additional cushioning is provided by the padded heel and toe area, which also protects against rubbing and makes these long socks durable.<br><br>The ventilation system on the shin and the webbing system on the foot provide the necessary moisture wicking and improved breathability. Merino wool means the Ski Compression Long Socks for men are naturally moisture- and odor-neutralizing while also feeling soft against the skin.",
