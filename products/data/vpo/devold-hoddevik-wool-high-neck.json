  "description": "The Hoddevik Sweater is a knitted original sweater, collected from the Devold archives. Like the other knitted garments in the family of Originals, the Hoddevik sweater will keep you exceptionally warm in all weather conditions. This chunky knit is not just a beautiful piece of craftmanship, but back in the days it was crucial as protective workwear for people working in the harsh climate along the Norwegian coast. The high-necked, insulating sweater combines history with sustainable, Norwegian wool \u2013 and is made to last for generations.",
