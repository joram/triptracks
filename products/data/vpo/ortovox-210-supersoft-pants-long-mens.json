  "description": "The 210 SUPERSOFT LONG PANTS for men is their most comfortable functional underwear for winter days in the mountains, and will keep you warm and dry.<br><br>Their 210 SUPERSOFT line is made of a unique fabric that combines all the advantages of merino wool with a soft feel. The 210 MERINO SUPERSOFT combines the temperature and moisture-regulating properties of fine, Tasmanian merino wool on the outside with sustainable TENCEL\u2122 MODAL on the inside, which feels particularly soft on the skin. As with MERINO WOOL, TENCEL\u2122 MODAL is a natural fiber that comes from sustainable forestry and is produced in an environmentally friendly manufacturing process.<br><br>The 210 SUPERSOFT LONG PANTS for men is thus super sustainable, very warm and, thanks to its smooth surface, robust and long lasting. It can cope with even the most demanding descents thanks to optimal moisture absorption, guaranteeing full functionality with a soft core.",
