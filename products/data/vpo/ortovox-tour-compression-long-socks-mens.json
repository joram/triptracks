  "description": "What if your legs didn\u2019t get tired on a long climb? It\u2019s every mountaineer\u2019s dream! That\u2019s exactly why the tour compression long socks for women/men are going to be your new favorites.<br><br>Their compression function complies with the european cen standard and provides class 1 compression (mild pressure, 15\u201321mmhg). The compression effect is higher in the ankle area than at the calf, helping the veins to carry low-oxygen, high-lactate blood back to the heart to be replaced by fresh blood. Thus, supply to the muscles is improved and premature fatigue prevented.<br><br>Even the fit of the tour compression long socks for women/men scores top marks: the ergonomic right/left fit ensures the socks sit exactly where they should, while their flat construction prevents creasing and pressure. Elastic cuffs and a stabilizing zone at the ankles stops the socks slipping. In addition, the toe seam is kept flat to prevent blisters, and padding in the heel and toe areas ensures they are comfortably cushioned. And a 360-degree webbing system on the foot makes these socks especially breathable.<br><br>Merino wool really comes into its own in socks, naturally regulating moisture and temperature while neutralizing unpleasant odors. And the tour compression long socks for women/men are comfortable and feel just as at home on demanding ski tours as on local and high alpine tours \u2013 whenever there\u2019s no time for tiredness.&nbsp;",
