  "description": "The all mountain quarter socks for men ensure pleasant, blister-free comfort on alpine tours thanks to soft merino wool and a seamless circular knitting technique.<br><br>Merino yarn at 21.5 microns in thickness is elastic, stable and pleasant on the skin. The natural properties of fine merino wool really come into their own in the foot area, naturally regulating temperature and moisture while also neutralizing unpleasant odors. The circular-knitted all mountain quarter socks for men are designed to fit perfectly without any irritating seams, thus reducing areas that rub or dig in. An ankle and arch support ensures a good fit and prevents the socks from slipping or creasing. You can also say goodbye to blisters in the toe area in future thanks to the flat toe seam.<br><br>The all mountain quarter socks for men are thus the ideal companion for summer alpine activities.",
