  "description": "Prana's men\u2019s Novad Path Jacket was expertly crafted to handle cold weather, down to the tiniest details. And yeah, it looks amazing too.<br><br>Made with Responsible Down Standard (RDS) certified insulation, which ensures that the welfare of the birds providing down and feathers is respected at all times, this jacket has a high fill weight that keeps you warm without the extra bulk. It\u2019s ready for sudden showers too, thanks to a PFC-Free DWR (durable water repellent) coating and critically taped seams to help keep moisture out.<br><br>And they weren\u2019t kidding around with those details. You\u2019ll find a removable hood with store-away attachments for a clean silhouette, armhole gussets for extra comfort and mobility, soft micro fleece lining at the neck and hand pockets, and so much more than we could ever fit in this description.",
