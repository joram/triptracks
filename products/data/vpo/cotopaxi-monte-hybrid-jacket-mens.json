  "description": "Designed to ditch excess heat when you\u2019re moving fast and keep you warm and comfortable when you\u2019re at a standstill, our all-new Men\u2019s Monte Hybrid Jacket stylishly solves the hot-cold-hot-cold dilemma of stop-and-go winter days outside. The Monte\u2019s modern hybrid construction is built around its lightweight Polartec\u00ae Alpha active insulation, which provides ample core warmth while remaining highly breathable for cold, high-output pursuits like snowshoeing, backcountry skiing, and winter trail running. Cotopaxi used 100% recycled polyester for the shell, and soft, breathable, recycled polyester stretch fleece in the sleeves and side panels for improved moisture management and full freedom of movement. And with versatile colors and a stylish design, the Monte Hybrid knows how to keep it casual for cold-weather commutes, winter travels, and downtown dinners.",
