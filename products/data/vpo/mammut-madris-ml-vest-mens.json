  "description": "A sporty mid-layer for hiking and everyday wear. The Madris Vest features a special, double-woven material that is soft and comfortable on the inside while being robust and wind-repellent on the outside. Thanks to a PFC-free DWR treatment, the vest is also water-repellent. A chest pocket made from contrast material and two slit pockets offer storage space. The practical Madris Vest can be put on quickly and is great for transitions as well as an insulating layer on cold days.",
