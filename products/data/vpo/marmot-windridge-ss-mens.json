  "description": "Lightweight, breathable, and moisture wicking, the Men's Windridge Short-Sleeve Shirt was built for long days on the crag. As the hours are passing and the temps are rising, stay cool with side mesh panels that provide increased ventilation. Built-in UPF-50 sun protection shields your skin from dangerous rays. Forward-set shoulder seams ensure you stay comfortable whether you've got a harness or a backpack on, while flatlock seams reduce irritation and chafing. The drop-tail hem won't ride up and provides extra coverage as you scale the next pitch.",
