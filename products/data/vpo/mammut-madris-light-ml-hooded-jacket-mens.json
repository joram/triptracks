  "description": "The hooded Madris Light is a very versatile midlayer jacket, ideal for any outdoor activity. The material is lightweight, wind-repellent and breathable, and the fleece waffle structure on the inside makes it pleasant to wear. Spandex provides freedom of movement while the recycled polyester content makes the jacket environmentally friendly. Flat seams prevent unpleasant chafing when you\u2019re carrying a backpack. The tight-fitting hood fits under your helmet. The color-contrasting zipper chest pocket is a practical and attractive detail.",
