  "description": "Lightweight, hardwearing jacket for the discerning hunter who is looking for highly functional equipment for active hunting days. Designed so that you can move quickly and freely over large distances. Its \u201cDNA\u201d has been taken from the award-winning Keb Jacket, with wind and water resistant G-1000 Silent Eco in recycled polyester and organic cotton on the front, shoulders and lower sleeves, while the back, upper sleeves and pockets are made from stretch fabric. This gives a quiet, lightweight and very pliant jacket with excellent breathability. A number of well-thought-through features make it easier for you to focus on the hunt and your surroundings. <br><br>One example is the easily accessed sleeve pocket with ammunition holders on the left sleeve, and the attachment for a communication radio on the left shoulder. Additional ammunition can be stored in a pair of large, flat pockets with flaps at the lower front. There are also two spacious vertical chest pockets, both with zippers and one with an inside pocket in mesh for a radio or mobile phone. The zippered openings at the sides release excess heat and the front zipper is two way so it can be opened from both ends for ventilation. A well fitting, adjustable hood provides perfect protection against cold winds but can be zipped off when it is not in use. Drawcord adjustments at the hem and Velcro adjustments at the sleeve cuffs.",
