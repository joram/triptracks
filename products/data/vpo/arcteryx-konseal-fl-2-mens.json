  "description": "Fast and light, nimble and secure, the Konseal FL 2 feels as agile as a running shoe while delivering the support, comfort and confidence required for technical approaches and long hikes under the load of a pack. A shoe made for shifting terrain, it utilizes a Vibram\u00ae Megagrip outsole for a secure hold and a TPU chassis and raised sidewalls for increased stability. The fit is precise and the minimalist design reduces debris collection and easily transitions to more civilized landscapes.<br><br>Updates include a redesigned upper for improved breathability and flex, a lug pattern for better balancing, smearing and traction, and a lighter weight, non-absorbent insole.",
