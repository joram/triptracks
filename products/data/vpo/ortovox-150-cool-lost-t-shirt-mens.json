  "description": "Tried-and-tested functionality with sustainable cooling: beta-spun technology gives our popular 150 Merino cool line stability. That\u2019s why the 150 merino cool shirts and tops are particularly long- lasting and robust \u2013 without having to sacrifice the cooling effect of Tencel\u2122 lyocell. This is due to a complicated process in which a generous number of fine polyamide filaments are spun around a core of merino wool and Tencel\u2122 lyocell. The fabric is made more scuff- and tear-resistant thanks to the protective polyamide outer layer, while still maintaining the benefits of natural fibers. The 150 merino Cool line is therefore just as suited to demanding alpine tours as long alpine climbs.",
