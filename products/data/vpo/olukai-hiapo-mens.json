  "description": "What makes an OluKai sandal truly built to last? They like to think it\u2019s a few things: tradition, craftsmanship, and attention to detail. The Hiapo is constructed with naturally tumbled or marbled full-grain leather using hand-sewn traditional whipstitching, complete with moko tattoo artwork details on the footbed. One of their original sandals (hence, its namesake), Hiapo only gets better with age.",
