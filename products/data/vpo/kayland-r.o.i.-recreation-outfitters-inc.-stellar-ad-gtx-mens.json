  "description": "All the precision and technical characteristics you expect in a fast-and-light mountaineering boot, but with the shoe-like feel of a trail shoe: they\u2019re snug and a pleasure to wear, with a construction based around an anatomical last. Stellar AD GTX is an ultra-lightweight crampon-compatible high-altitude boot, which is ideal to use on rock, mixed, snow and ice, and for climbing.\nFeaturing a lighter, more streamlined structure than its sister Stellar GTX, Stellar AD GTX has been designed for expert users who prefer a lower-cut construction for multiactivity use. Its secret is the new construction technique used for the sole unit: the foot sits directly on top of the soft PU midsole to maximize cushioning and ensure precise foot placement, as well as providing impact resistance on rough terrain. Stellar AD GTX is an innovative shoe providing superior comfort that represents the evolution of Kayland's mountaineering DNA \u2013 exploring the boundaries of speed and experience: the feel of the fit is totally new, and its aggressive styling is in a class of its own.",
