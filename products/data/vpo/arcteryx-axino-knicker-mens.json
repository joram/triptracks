  "description": "The Axino Knicker adds a layer of air permeable insulation under ski bibs or shell pants. The Axino\u2019s combination of Coreloft\u2122 Continuous insulation, Permeair\u2122 nylon lining and the Fortius\u2122 Air 40 softshell outer allows air to move freely through the knicker to preserve a dry, comfortable microclimate within your layering system. The low profile design layers easily without adding bulk, the knicker length fits comfortably above boots, and articulated patterning provides freedom of movement.",
