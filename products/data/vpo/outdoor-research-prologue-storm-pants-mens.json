  "description": "You don't need to look like you're charging up a mountain every time you're suffering through a rainy commute. The Prologue Storm Pants give you just as much reliable waterproof protection as you want from all of your outdoor pursuits, but with a sleek urban style perfectly fit for the boardroom - or the bouldering cave. These pants look nothing like your ordinary rain pants. Their functional fly, belt loops, and hand pockets that make this pair of hard shells look professional enough to blend in at the office, and feel as comfortable as jeans.",
