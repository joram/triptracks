  "description": "They developed their Pelmo pants for men in the Merino Sheild Zero line especially for the needs of mountain climbers who have to rely upon their equipment during long days but still need to keep things light. These short alpine pants are made of scuff-resistant material that remains elastic, light and breathable. <br><br>As far as features go, they\u2019ve focused upon what\u2019s important: Small essentials such as a cell phone or map can be stowed in the two pockets or the map pocket on the thigh. Soft merino mesh inserts in the waistband and pockets ensure maximum comfort in the right areas. <br><br>All this makes their Pelmo Shorts for men the perfect companion for alpine activities that demand lightness and functionality.",
