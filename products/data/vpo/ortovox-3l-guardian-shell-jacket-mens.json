It is also PFC-free and climate-neutral in the interest of sustainability.<br><br>To guarantee full freedom of movement, the 3L Guardian Shell Jacket for men is soft and lightweight. The ergonomic underarm ventilation zippers are easy to open and provide additional ventilation when the going gets tough. Details such as the higher hem adjustment and concealed hood adjustment ensure an optimum fit and easy use.<br><br>The spacious front pockets, inner pocket and ski pass pocket provide ample room for small objects and whatever else you don\u2019t want to put in your backpack. One particularly practical feature is the integrated cell phone pocket in the front left pocket, where merino mesh protects your battery against the cold.",
