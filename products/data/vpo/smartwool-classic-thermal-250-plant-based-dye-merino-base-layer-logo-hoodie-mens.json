  "description": "This men\u2019s Merino wool hoodie is designed with your comfort in mind. Instead of top-of-the-shoulder seams, it\u2019s constructed with shoulder panels\u2014wearing a backpack will feel like a breeze. Plus, the anti-chafing flatlock seams will mean you'll hardly notice the garment on your back. And, because they\u2019re colored with our eco-conscoius plant-based dye, each hoodie looks different, for a one-of-a-kind result.",
