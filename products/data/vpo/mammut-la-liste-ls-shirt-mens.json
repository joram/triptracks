  "description": "A fleecy, soft and cozy flannel long-sleeve shirt in the \u201cLa Liste\u201d special edition design. Made from organic cotton. Replacing the traditional button facing, a front zipper allows you to convert this comfortable leisure shirt to a warm mid-layer. Practical and stylish. The film \u201cLa Liste \u2013 Everything or Nothing\u201d documents the project conceived by MAMMUT Pro Team Athlete J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Heitz, in which he skis the most spectacular 6,000 meter peaks in an unprecedented new style. This sequel to the sensational first film has once again been produced in partnership with MAMMUT.",
