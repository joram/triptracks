  "description": "This season, the Devold\u00ae Her\u00f8y collection is extended with a hybrid jacket for men and women, and a pair of tight pants for woman. The new Devold\u00ae Her\u00f8y Merino Hybrid Jacket is a body-mapped, lightweight, breathable and wind-resistant mid-layer. Design features such as woven wind-resistant material on the chest, shoulders and hood provide extra protection from the weather conditions. The close-fitted hood can be folded into the collar when not in use. The Devold\u00ae Her\u00f8y Tight Pant is especially designed for women on the move. The slim-fitted design combines two different fabrics, with the inner fabric soft and comfortable next to your skin. The outer fabric is a woven, wind-resistant material, providing protection against wind and abrasion. Both the jacket and the tight pant have a soft Merino inside layer with excellent insulation and temperature-regulating properties, keeping you warm and dry on longer hikes in the mountains.",
