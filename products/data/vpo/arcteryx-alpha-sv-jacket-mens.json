  "description": "The iconic Alpha SV is a proven performer in severe alpine conditions. Obsession keeps us pushing forward, and working closely with Gore, they have developed the strongest Alpha SV Ever.<br><br>Utilizing extremely durable yet breathable Gore-Tex PRO with Most Rugged Technology, we have paired their most durable face fabric for incredibly long-lasting storm protection. The Micro Grid Backer enhances resistance to abrasion and contamination. The backer is dope dyed, a process using substantially less resources than traditional dye processes. Featured for confidence in extreme conditions, the Alpha SV includes an embedded RECCO\u00ae reflector for improved searchability in emergency situations, their helmet compatible StormHood\u2122, pit zips, and articulated construction that frees you to move across mountain terrain.",
