  "description": "The massive, bizarre towers of the pala group protrude from the stony alpine plateau. Climbing here in the southernmost mountain range of the dolomites takes strong nerves - and strong material. Their merino shield tec line was designed especially for long, alpine routes like these!<br><br>The extremely scuff-resistant outer material of the pala light jacket for men achieves more than 50,000 abrasion cycles in the martindale test, which is used to measure scuff resistance. Reinforcements in particularly high-stress areas such as the hips, shoulders and underarms offer maximum protection against craggy rocks. The 4-way stretch material provides full freedom of movement, enhanced by an athletic cut and anatomically shaped elbow areas. Thanks to its no-membrane construction, the pala light jacket for men is particularly breathable, while fine merino wool inside and merino mesh inserts in the collar and waistband offer additional comfort.<br><br>The pala light jacket for men has an elastic waistband and cuffs and, thanks to its high-reach performance fit, will move with your every athletic maneuver and is perfectly tailored for climbing. The breast pocket has space for a topo, cell phone, trail bar or other small items that you might need to grab quickly on a long day in the mountains.<br><br>For the sake of the environment, the entire merino shield tec line is also completely pfc-free and climate-neutral through carbon offsetting. With its fresh look, the pala light jacket for men is just right for big climbing routes on high rock faces.&nbsp;",
