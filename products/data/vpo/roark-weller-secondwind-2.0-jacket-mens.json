  "description": "As a trail runner and artist, Travis Weller is an understudy of nature\u2019s perennial drama as a passerby. Color and movement intersect \u201cout far\u201d from the order we call routine, somewhere between freedom and chaos. This collaboration celebrates our inevitable dance with the environment as we move through it.<br>The ultra lightweight and packable Second Wind jacket was born out of the need for trustworthy protection when poor weather rolls in and temperatures drop.<br><br>It is constructed from an ultra lightweight stretch ripstop fabric with a no-shine dry feel and durable water-resistant finish. The fit was shaped to perform on the trail and eliminate any drag on the go. The trimmer fit reduces the chances of snagging on branches and keeping the elements out while also reducing the size of the jacket when packed into the pocket. The durable front YKK Vislon\u2122 zipper will never fail and adds ease for taking the jacket on and off while on the move. Reflective elements are graphical and strategically placed for when the trail meets the road. The right shoulder reflective is for when running against traffic and the left back reflective element is for running with traffic. The partially elasticated hood edge, cuff opening and back hem gives secure closure to a relaxed structure so the product lays naturally and doesn\u2019t bunch. The Secondwind is the go-to packable jacket when you are unsure which direction the weather will go.",
