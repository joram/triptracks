  "description": "The Thoriums are made for mountain cold. The parka takes their performance farther. Extended for added coverage, it delivers warmth on winter\u2019s coldest days. The lofty 750 fill-power goose down is light, efficient, and responsibly sourced. Down Composite Mapping\u2122 strategically places Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation in areas prone to moisture, a bio-derived liner reduces petroleum use, and the light, durable Arato\u2122 30 nylon shell has a DWR treatment to repel water. An insulated StormHood\u2122 extends protection to give you full-coverage warmth.",
