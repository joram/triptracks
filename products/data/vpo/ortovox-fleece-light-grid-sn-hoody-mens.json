  "description": "On long days spent climbing, they need lightweight material that they can completely rely on. That\u2019s why they have the highest standards when it comes to their equipment: The Fleece light grid line is tailored to the needs of mountaineers who require both high insulation and ventilation combined with minimum weight and a small pack size. The fleeces are particularly light, yet still provide the necessary protection in cooler temperatures thanks to the inside channel structure. The Tasmanian merino wool on the inside also regulates moisture and temperature levels.",
