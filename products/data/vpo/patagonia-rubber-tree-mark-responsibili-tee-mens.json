  "description": "The Rubber Tree graphic is inspired by 1970s surfboard lams and celebrates the use of 85% Yulex\u00ae natural rubber in our wetsuits. It's fitting that the artwork is screen-printed on Patagonia\u2019s lowest carbon footprint T-shirt made with 100% recycled fabrics. By utilizing fabric scraps and recycled bottles, we reduce our reliance on virgin raw materials. Made in a Fair Trade Certified\u2122 factory.",
