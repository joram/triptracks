  "description": "The minimalistic Valbon pants for men are made for athletic tours when less is more.<br><br>With a natural material mix of organic cotton and hemp grown without pesticides, these lightweight climbing pants are particularly comfortable and yet durable and long-lasting. They have a loose fit with wide thigh-areas, an anatomically shaped knee area, and tapered ankle cuffs for athletic movements. The intelligent positioning of the 2-way stretch material and the insert in the crotch area guarantee even greater freedom of movement. The flat waistband sits perfectly under a climbing harness and is comfortable thanks to fine Tasmanian merino wool.<br><br>With no unnecessary seams or irritating pressure points, Valbon pants for men are perfectly tailored to climbing. The pockets can be accessed even when wearing a climbing harness, and thanks to an asymmetrical design and colorful accents these pants are also a real visual highlight.",
