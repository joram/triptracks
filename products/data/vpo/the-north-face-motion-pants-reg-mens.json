  "description": "They're soft. They're tough. TNF's Motion Trousers are what every explorer needs for next-level adventuring. With stretchy organic cotton, elastane fabric and articulated knees, every feature of these trousers is designed to let you move about freely when you're hitting the trail or scrambling up hillsides. But that's not to say they're not equally at home on your commute: we've added in reflective tape to keep you visible on dark journeys to and from the office, and there's even a D-ring on the belt loop to keep your keys safely stowed.",
