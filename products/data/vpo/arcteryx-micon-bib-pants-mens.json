  "description": "You don\u2019t always plan where you\u2019re going to make your turns. You follow your impulse - backcountry, on-piste. That\u2019s the essence of freeride. The Micon is created to go wherever that impulse takes you. Its hybrid construction leverages two types of waterproof, windproof GORE-TEX fabric to reach an optimal balance of breathability, durability, and comfort. The full-length bib seals out snow, side vents let you dump heat on skin tracks, and its advanced design is reflected in its progressive look.",
