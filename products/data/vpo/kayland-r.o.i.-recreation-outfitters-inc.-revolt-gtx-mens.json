  "description": "Kayland's new low-cut shoe, designed for fast hikes at medium altitudes on varied terrain. Lightweight and protective, Revolt features a suede upper and synthetic inserts. The real innovation of the shoe is the direct lamination of the Gore-Tex Invisible Fit membrane onto the upper: Revolt is the first shoe ever to have this process integrated into the leather. Direct lamination ensures that all creases and wrinkles are eliminated, thus reducing pressure points and ensuring a perfect fit. The construction technique helps reduce shoe weight, cut down water absorption and speed up drying times. The lacing system comprises a webbing of laces that tighten the upper to provide enhanced comfort and precision.\nThe EVA midsole and Vibram\u00ae Megagrip outsole make Revolt an ideal shoe for using even on approaches, thanks to the tread pattern designed specifically for varied terrain, with maximum grip on the heel and large toe area to ensure safety when climbing.\nExcellent ankle supported is provide by Kayland's Ankle Lock System which ensures totally natural movement.",
