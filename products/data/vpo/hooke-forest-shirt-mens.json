  "description": "Hook\u00e9 has finally conceived and designed its own camouflage model for hunting in the forest.<br><br>In collaboration with the artist Alex L'Heureux, the design is first made of bark, branches and maple leaves, national emblem and master of our boreal forests. The whole thing is finally completed with meticulously chosen spruce branches that have character to enhance the design and facilitate blending with the background. This camouflage, paired with a stretchy, soft, silent and strong polyester blend, allows the hunter to fit perfectly into the mixed forest and blend into the landscape of deer and other small game.<br><br>Their forest camo shirt also offers 2 chest pockets with flap and button closure, one with a hidden accessory loop for tool attachment.<br><br>A piece extremely appreciated by the hunting community.",
