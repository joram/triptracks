  "description": "The main fabric is a 30D Gore-tex\u00ae 2-layer rip-stop recycled nylon. This provides a light, soft feel, while still offering full waterproofness. The jacket is reinforced with Gore-tex\u00ae 2-layer 70D recycled nylon on exposed areas. It's insulated with 100% recycled Primaloft Silver Insulation Bio, which is distributed according to body mapping: The main is 80g/m2,, the shoulders are 100g/m2, and put 60g/m2, in the hood and forearm area. <br><br>The jacket is the first choice for the coldest freeride adventures: it's as soft as an insulation layer, and as durable and protective as a hard shell. It is crafted to deliver great warmth combined with every essential function to perform in the rugged mountains. It's a replica of the first Primaloft lofoten, but with all recycled materials. <br><br>Deriving from the iconic lofoten concept, the design is kept clean and minimalistic with solutions to enhance your freeride experience. It has a regular to relaxed fit tailored for ski/snowboard activities with a y-shaped cut and articulated arms to ensure mobility. The back is made a bit longer for extra protection, and the asymmetric cuffs will also prevent unwanted exposure.",
