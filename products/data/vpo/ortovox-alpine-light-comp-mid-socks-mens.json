  "description": "Thanks to light compression, the Alpine Light Comp Mid Socks for men ensure a longer and more relaxed pleasure when mountaineering, alpine touring or climbing. \n\nEspecially in the descent, but also in the ascent, the calf muscles must compensate for numerous blows and vibrations. The muscles are continuously stressed and can quickly become tired. Gentle compression distributes pressure evenly between the ankle and calf and effectively protects the muscles from rapid fatigue.\n\nA perfect fit is ensured by the ergonomic right-left fit as well as the elastic double waistband and a special ankle stabilization zone that prevents the sock from slipping. Flat toe seams prevent possible blisters and the padded heel and toe area provides additional cushioning and protects against abrasion.\n\nA ventilation system on the shin and a mesh system on the foot ensure optimal moisture wicking and improve breathability. Thanks to merino wool, the ALPINE LIGHT COMP MID SOCKS for men are also pleasantly soft on the skin, climate-regulating and odor-resistant.",
