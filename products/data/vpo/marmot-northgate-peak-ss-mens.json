  "description": "Trail hike in the morning, then local brewery in the evening? Wear the Men's Northgate Peak Short-Sleeve Shirt. The lightweight, breathable, and quick-drying stretch fabric will keep up with you, while its semi-fitted design and collared neck have enough style points to catch up with friends after the day is done. Carrying a pack? Good news: This button-down shirt offers a tighter fit along the shoulder seams and armholes for more comfort. Flat-felled seams reduce abrasions and add durability, while built-in UPF 50 sun protection keeps you covered.",
