  "description": "<p>Uncompromising protection from cold and wet weather. The Nordwand Thermo offers the benefits of a hardshell and an insulated jacket in one.</p>\n<p>The exterior is made of waterproof Gore-Tex\u00ae for lasting, reliable protection against wind and water. The stretchy synthetic lining ensures optimal heat retention. And the stretchy insulation not only keeps you nice and warm \u2013 you\u2019ll also feel much less constricted.</p>\n<p>The Nordwand Thermo offers the same technical features you would expect from a non-insulated hardshell jacket. A removeable snow skirt, large mesh internal pockets and plenty of other features meet all your winter needs.</p>\n<p>The Nordwand Thermo was designed specifically with ice climbing and winter mountaineering in mind. The wide range of features make it a jacket you can count on whenever you find yourself in wet, cold and stormy places.</p>",
