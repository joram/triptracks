  "description": "The iconic trollveggen Gore-Tex Pro Jacket is our most durable and protective mountaineering jacket.<br><br>The trollveggen Gore-Tex Pro is our pinnacle of mountaineering performance made with extremely durable 70D recycled nylon Gore-Tex Pro fabric. This iconic jacket is historic, dating back to Europe\u2019s first Gore-Tex\u00ae jacket in 1977. Today, it\u2019s still a legend within mountaineering due to continuous user-driven product development. With the new generation, we\u2019ve redesigned the construction, decreasing the number of parts and seams to provide a more ergonomic fit and allow more efficient movement.<br><br>This also increases durability due to fewer exposed connection areas. As a bonus, it looks cleaner while still offering everything you need for any alpine pursuit. It\u2019s made in a new recycled Gore-Tex 70D wave fabric and we\u2019ve added additional length in the back for extra protection.<br><br>The jacket has long underarm two-way zippers to provide good ventilation. The storm fitted hood fits a climbing helmet and the two napoleon chest pockets are kept high to avoid interference when using a harness.<br><br>The two hand pockets offer extra storage and a hand-warming option when belaying, and also conceals an adjustment cord which can tighten the waistline to trap air if needed.<br><br>Despite the longer fit and extra pockets, we\u2019ve managed to match the weight of the previous generation. It has reflective details and we\u2019ve strategically placed color blocks on the dark jacket to ensure visibility and contrast on critical body parts.",
