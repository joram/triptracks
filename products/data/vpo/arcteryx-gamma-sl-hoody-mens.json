  "description": "A hike can be an easy ramble or a destination-driven charge up to a backcountry lake or the start of a climb or ski tour. Whatever your mission, you need protection that adapts to shifting microclimates and weather. The Gamma SL Hoody delivers. Its light, durable Fortius\u2122 1.0 double weave resists wind and water, breathes, and offers four-way stretch. A StormHood\u2122 adds protection without impacting peripheral vision, while the articulated trim fit and efficient design keep it streamlined on the move.",
