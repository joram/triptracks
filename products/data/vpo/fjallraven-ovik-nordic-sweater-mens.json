  "description": "Enjoy winter\u2019s colder temps in a classic knitted wool sweater. The pattern is inspired by traditional Scandinavian fishermen\u2019s sweaters, and the knitting has a lofty structure that insulates well and is light and easy to move about in. Perhaps it also warms a green heart knowing that the wool comes from farms that follow the strictest criteria regarding animal welfare, land stewardship and chemical use.",
