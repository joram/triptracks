  "description": "The svalbard heavy duty Pants are very durable all season pants made to withstand heavy activity in rough terrain. Made in long-lasting and strong organic cotton/polyester fabric these pants are comfortable with great breathability, and the flexible water resistant fabric used in the seat and knees ensures extra flexibility and protection. The pants offer details like full thigh venting with mesh lining, the Custom-Fit Waist\u2122 system, lower leg reinforcement and a hidden gaitor hook. The lower legs have zippered gusset if you wish to widen the leg, and they also have a cord adjustment at the bottom if you\u2019re into a tighter fit. A little wear and tear never scared off these classics and they have become a favorite amongst many handy men as well the outdoor guys.",
