  "description": "On long mountain and high altitude tours, the robust all mountain long socks effortlessly defy the cold and keep the feet pleasantly warm. Particularly fine merino wool with a thickness of 21.5 microns is pleasant on the skin and makes the knee socks elastic and stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially on multi-day tours with overnight stays in huts, the natural properties of merino wool come into their own: because it is naturally temperature and moisture regulating, dries quickly and neutralizes unpleasant odors. A comfortable waistband, ergonomic fit, and ankle and arch support ensure a comfortable, wrinkle-free and slip-free fit even in heavy hiking or high-altitude touring boots. A padded heel and toe area makes the knee sock durable and absorbs minor shocks when walking up and down hills. Last but not least, the modern and cheerful design makes the all mountain long socks the ideal companion for demanding and long mountain and high altitude tours on cold days.",
