The Wide Last version for broader feet provides more room at the forefoot and ball of the foot.

The modern, shock-absorbing Vibram\u00ae sole construction with lower stack height provides additional stability in rugged terrain. And the GORE-TEX lining keeps your feet dry in wet and snowy conditions. <br><br>*** All Hanwag boots are sold under UK sizing - Please see size chart for details/conversion",
