  "description": "A new look for a classic: the Ultimate V SO Vest Men impresses with a lighter and more modern design. It features a windproof, elastic, robust, year-round quality 3-layer GORE\u00ae Windstopper\u00ae material, developed exclusively with GORE\u00ae, as well as wind and chin protection to ward off cold air. A DWR treatment on the outer material of the jacket repels water. A membrane and a lightweight backing with an open 3D structure provide optimal moisture-wicking and greater breathability, thanks to a wicking finish that absorbs moisture from your skin and speeds up the drying process. Partial bonding on the edges of the hem and collar creates a streamlined and technical look, as well as preventing friction on the skin. Ensuring nothing gets in the way of your mountain adventure.",
