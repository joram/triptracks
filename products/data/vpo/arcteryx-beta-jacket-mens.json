Made with a durable 80D face fabric and a GORE-TEX ePE (expanded polyethylene) membrane that\u2019s light, strong, and PFC-free, it delivers lasting waterproof, windproof, breathable protection with a reduced carbon footprint. The C-KNIT backer adds comfort, and the low-profile StormHood adjusts with a quick pull to provide coverage and maintain lines of sight. Articulation removes restriction, and an embedded RECCO reflector can aid in search emergencies.</p>\n<p>Updated with a new durable, lightweight GORE-TEX ePE fabric that offers a reduced carbon footprint and has an 80D face fabric for enhanced durability without added weight.</p>\n<p></p>",
