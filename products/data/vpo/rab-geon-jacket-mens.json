  "description": "The new Geon Jacket is a true all-mountain fleece. Built as a breathable midlayer for high-energy cold-weather use, it is equally practical for walking in the hills and for easy-boost insulation during your post-climb downtime. <br><br>The Geon Jacket is a midweight stretch fleece, designed to provide low-bulk layering insulation for cold-weather climbing, scrambling and hiking. Built from our polyester-based Thermic\u2122 fabric, it combines inherent hydrophobic properties with outstanding breathability to help move moisture through the layers and away from your skin. A brushed grid backer increases strength, comfort and warmth retention and, with its athletic fit and low-bulk flatlock seams, the Geon Jacket will also sit very comfortably between a baselayer and a shell. Additional mountain features include a pair of discreet, harness-compatible YKK\u00ae zipped hand pockets and a full-length YKK\u00ae front zip so you can adjust your ventilation on the move.<br><br>With its active style, features and colour options, the Geon Jacket is an authentic mountain midlayer that is equally comfortable as a three-season everyday outer.",
