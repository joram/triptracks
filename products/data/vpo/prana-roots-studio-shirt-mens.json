  "description": "A conversational print BBQ shirt with a conscience, our Roots Studio Shirt for men is so much more than just cool. Part of our Roots Studio x prAna collaboration, each design was created by an indigenous artist, allowing them to honor their heritage and provide for their family without taking the physical and financial risks of leaving their community to do so.<br><br>But that's just the start, because the purchase of this print also helps support the artist's tribe or village. How does it work? From the profits returned, about 20% go to the artist while 80% is put into a community fund, where the governing body of that tribe or village prioritizes how it can best be used to benefit their people.<br><br>With a positive purpose behind this design, plus a bold collaboration print that moves from workday to weekend with ease, this clearly is not your average button down. This storied style is the perfect way to bring some deeper meaning into your weekly wardrobe.",
