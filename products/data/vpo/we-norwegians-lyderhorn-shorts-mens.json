  "description": "We have expanded our product line this season with a selection of wind breakers that we think works perfectly over our t-shirts and knitted pieces. The fabric we have chosen, is an Italian manufactured quality in bi-stretch which is super comfortable. It was important for us to find a quality which is \"silent\" when the wind hits, especially out at sea, and we have indeed found it with this great company called Olmetex, situated in the Lake Como area. The garments are all lined with a soft, mesh lining, made from recycled polyester. The men's track shorts have an elasticated waist and zipped front pockets. Wear them with the Lyderhorn jacket when you are out boating.",
