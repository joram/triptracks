  "description": "Inspired by surfer Rob Machado, the Infinity Boardshort has all the details you need for your best session yet. Moisture-wicking fabric with 4-way stretch and an interior neoprene waistband keep you comfortable in the waves (and lounging in the sand after), while the zip pocket keeps your keys or other essentials safe and secure. Built with recycled materials and upcycled coconut making them naturally anti-microbial as well. Beach days just got better.",
