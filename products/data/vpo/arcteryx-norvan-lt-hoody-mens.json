  "description": "Running has a cadence. So do the seasons. Wind, rain, sleet, and snow - running all year requires protection that meets exceptional demands. Weighing mere ounces, the Norvan LT delivers windproof, waterproof protection in a lightweight, efficient run-specific shell. Made from Gore-Tex fabric with Gore C-Knit\u2122 backer technology, it is quiet and highly breathable. The trim fit minimizes bulk, articulation adds freedom of movement, and the fitted hood provides additional coverage.",
