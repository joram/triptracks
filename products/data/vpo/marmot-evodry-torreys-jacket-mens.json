  "description": "Whether you're at the crag or campsite, gear up with the lightweight protection of the Men's EVODry Torreys Jacket. Part of Marmot's EVODry collection, the most sustainable rain jackets they've ever made that are now more breathable than ever, it features waterproof and breathable 2.5-layer Marmot\u00ae MemBrain\u00ae Eco fabric to keep you dry whatever weather comes your way. PFC-free DWR (Durable Water-Repellent) finish and 100% seam taping provide even more water resistance. Heat-releasing PitZips improve airflow and help regulate body temperature if you work up a sweat. An adjustable drawcord hem, Velcro\u00ae cuffs, and center front zipper provide even more coverage from the elements. Articulated elbows increase your range of motion, and the attached hood with an adjustable drawcord won't interfere with your helmet.",
