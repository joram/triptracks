  "description": "Mighty glacial crevasses, combined rock and ice terrain and impressive summits: on alpine tours, we need clothing that is adaptable and that we can 100% rely upon. This is exactly where their westalpen softshell line comes into play: a combination of scuff-resistant merino naturetec rips inserts, naturetec light material and fine merino wool on the inside makes this line robust, breathable and comfortable.<br><br>What\u2019s special about the westalpen softshell high-alpine touring pants for men is the quick-gaiter system, which completely replaces gaiters: this hem adjustment developed by ortovox can be easily and quickly adjusted in three steps and fits seamlessly over mountaineering boots. The fastening straps for under your mountaineering boots are made of abrasion-resistant dyneema material and allow for neat, easy storage when not in use. Thanks to additional features such as ventilation zippers and abrasion-resistant schoeller\u00ae inserts for protection against sharp edges, their westalpen softshell high-alpine touring pants for men can be adapted to all situations and weather conditions. Merino mesh inserts at the adjustable waistband make the pants even more comfortable.&nbsp;",
