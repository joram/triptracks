  "description": "The Sapuen High GTX is the right choice on all kinds of terrain. Mammut Flextron\u00ae technology supports the natural rolling movement of the foot and thus more efficient use of energy when hiking and mountaineering, while Mammut Georganic\u00ae 3D technology guarantees maximum comfort. All components in contact with the foot are anatomically shaped with great precision while the classic tongue construction offers easy entry. Optimized for hiking: a Vibram rubber blend for secure grip on outdoor surfaces and a sole design that supports self-cleaning. The waterproof GORE-TEX membrane guarantees dry feet.",
