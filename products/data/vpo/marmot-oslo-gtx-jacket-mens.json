  "description": "Batten down the hatches in your Oslo GORE-TEX\u00ae Down Jacket when weather goes sideways. We combined the powers of a high-performance 2-layer GORE-TEX\u00ae shell with lofty 700-fill-power down insulation for complete seam-taped waterproof and windproof comfort on wet, freezing treks above the Arctic Circle or to the subway station on your winter morning commute. Down insulation starts inside your hood and runs all the way down below your butt so you'll feel that puffy, cloud-like warmth just about everywhere.",
