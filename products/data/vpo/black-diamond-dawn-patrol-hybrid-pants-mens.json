  "description": "The Dawn Patrol Hybrid Pants are built for going deep in the backcountry. By utilizing Black Diamond's proprietary BD.dry\u2122 waterproof/breathable solution on key areas that require protection, while featuring a breathable softshell fabric on crucial panels that are prone to overheating, the Dawn Patrol Hybrid Pant brings exactly what you need to a day of touring-uphill performance and freedom, downhill security for getting pitted. Side-zip vents add temperature regulation and two thigh pockets-one being a dedicated pocket for beacon storage and a smaller upper right hip pocket allow you to stow backcountry essentials. An integrated RECCO reflector adds to the pants\u2019 snow safety capabilities, while the instep patches guard against ski edges and crampon points. There is a stretch gaiter and the cuffs feature dual snap closures to accommodate both racing and touring boots. The integrated belt provides waist adjustment along with internal loops to allow for suspender compatibility.",
