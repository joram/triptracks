  "description": "Smartwool has updated the fit in their year-round Merino 150 Base Layer Bottoms to improve functionality while enhancing aesthetics. Ultra-smooth Merino helps regulate body temperature, breathes well, and naturally resists odors. What else do you need in a baselayer? How about smooth flatlock seams to help minimize chafing and a wide, fabric-covered waistband? With their Core Spun technology, they've wrapped Merino around a nylon core for added durability while still keeping the comfort of ultra-soft Merino next to skin. It's everything you need and more to adventure all year long.",
