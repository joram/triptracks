  "description": "Plain old cotton tees don\u2019t hold a candle to our Mountain Horizon Graphic Short Sleeve Tee. It\u2019s made with a blend of responsibly sourced Merino wool and recycled polyester, so you know this shirt is soft, odor-resistant, temperature-regulating, and durable. Plus, it has additional comfort details like flatlock and offset seams that help reduce chafing. And the mountain graphic on the front adds just the right pizzazz to take you from the trailhead to errands around town and back again.<br><br>Although this hoodie was built on our Men's regular fit design block, it is intended to be a Unisex item. For Men, please order your regular size. For Women, we recommend to size down one size from your standard size. If you prefer an oversized look, then we would recommend ordering your standard Women's size.",
