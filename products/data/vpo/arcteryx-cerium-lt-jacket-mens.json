  "description": "Worn as a mid layer or standalone piece in cool, dry conditions, the Cerium LT Jacket delivers exceptional warmth for little weight. Premium 850 fill down is resilient, lofty and warm. The Arato\u2122 10 shell provides lightweight durability, and Down Composite Mapping\u2122 strategically places Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation in moisture-prone areas. Articulated construction moves with the body, and sewn-through construction is used to further reduce weight and increase packability.",
