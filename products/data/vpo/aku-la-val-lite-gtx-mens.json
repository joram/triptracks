  "description": "Extremely versatile and comfortable for walking along valley bottoms or gentle trails through the forest. The leather suede upper with Gore-Tex lining insures your feet stay dray and comfortable all day long. With the AKU exclusive Elica Natural Stride System your weight is more evenly distributed across the sole and footbed of the shoe. This allows for better grip, a more anatomical stride, and less fatigue.",
