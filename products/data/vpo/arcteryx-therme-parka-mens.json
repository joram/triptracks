  "description": "Sometimes the urban landscape requires alpine performance. A truly waterproof and windproof Gore-Tex cotton like face fabric creates a streamlined look that gives warmth and weather protection on the harshest days. Down Contour Construction\u2122 allows the down to form to the body, delivering more efficient thermal performance. Down Composite Mapping\u2122 effectively places down and synthetic insulation where they deliver the most benefit. Lofty, high performance 750 fill power European goose down lines the core and sleeves where warmth is most needed. Coreloft\u2122 synthetic insulation is used at the cuffs, hood and under the arms, areas prone to contact with moisture. Internal cuff gaskets seal out drafts and enhance comfort.<br><br>Redesign includes updated style lines for a more relaxed fit, a two-way WaterTight\u2122 Vislon zipper with a snap placket, and synthetically insulated hood and neck gasket for additional warmth.",
