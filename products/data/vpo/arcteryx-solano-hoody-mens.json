  "description": "Every day the city\u2019s a little different. People, architecture, sounds, pace, light \u2013 always shifting. The weather, too. The Solano\u2019s made for changing conditions. Its GORE-TEX INFINIUM\u2122 fabric is windproof, breathable, and resists rain, its hood adds protection, and the brushed polyester lining wicks moisture and adds comfort. The comfortable relaxed fit is structured for clean lines and contemporary style, freedom of movement is built in with articulated patterning and gusseted underarms, and discrete reflective elements improve visibility \u2013 great for the bike ride home.<br><br>Updated with reflective elements, a comfortable relaxed fit, and revised style lines.",
