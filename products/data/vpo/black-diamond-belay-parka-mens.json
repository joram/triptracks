  "description": "Completely redesigned in 2023 to endure bail-worthy belay conditions on single-pitch winter routes and huge alpine faces alike, the Black Diamond Belay Parka lets you hunker down while your partner battles it out on the sharp end. Our warmest synthetic jacket, the Belay Parka features 200gsm mapped Primaloft Rise, plus Primaloft Gold Cross Core, insulation throughout the body, shoulders, and hood. A 50D PFC-free ripstop shell protects from the elements while a 20D nylon taffeta liner adds an extra layer of warmth. A two-way zipper allows access to your belay device, and oversized hand, chest and internal drop pockets store gloves, water bottles and other on-route essentials.",
