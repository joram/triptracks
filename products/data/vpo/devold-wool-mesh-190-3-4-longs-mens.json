  "description": "The Devold\u00ae Wool Mesh collection is designed for high-intensity activities, which meet high demands of moisture wicking, weight and breathability. The garments consist of 100 % Merino wool, are highly elastic and have smart ventilation opportunities. The wool mesh dries quickly, pressing excess heat and moisture from perspiration away from your body. When the temperature drops, the mesh provides good insulation via the air pockets arising between the skin and the insulation layer. Devold Wool Mesh is perfect for mountaintop tours in the winter, when the focus is on temperature regulation and low weight. Wide waistband - For added comfort the baselayer has a wide Merino wool waist band, providing comfortable fit as well as perfect shape.",
