  "description": "The Teca is a highly packable, weather-resistant layer that's ideal for windy ridge hikes, breezy bike rides, and minimalist travels. It's made with panels of DWR-treated, repurposed polyester taffeta and features a large front kangaroo pocket, a front flap pocket, and an internal phone pocket that doubles as a stuff sack. The Teca's form-fitting scuba hood and front zip help you batten down the hatches when the winds kick up.",
