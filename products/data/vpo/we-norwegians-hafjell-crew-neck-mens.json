  "description": "They have collaborated with one of the finest knitters in Veneto, Italy, along with Biella Yarn, by S\u00fcdwolle, to develop a line of ski sweaters in 100% fine merino wool. The inspiration for these sweaters are from the 70's , but they have reworked them to be more functional and comfortable. They are knitted with a 2/48 yarn, with ribbed details and color block panels. The quality has a thick hand-feel, that is similar to a \"scuba\" quality, but it's breathable and soft to the skin. This jacket is finished with an Italian zipper, and a mock neck collar. Use it as a mid-layer paired with any of their SN\u00d8 base layers and the Voss long johns.",
