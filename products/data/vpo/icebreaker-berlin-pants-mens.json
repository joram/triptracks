  "description": "The Berlin Pants are classic, comfortable, and extremely versatile chino pants for everyday casual style. Made from a soft and breathable woven twill blending merino wool and organic cotton, these pants feature a classic design, belt-loop waist, and natural Corozo buttons. \n\nInspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
