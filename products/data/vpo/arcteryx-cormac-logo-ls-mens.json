  "description": "Great for a little extra coverage on cool days \u2013 and sun protection in the summer \u2013 the long-sleeve Cormac delivers performance comfort. Ostria\u2122, its lightweight gridded fabric, feels great, breathes, stretches, provides UPF 50+ protection, and is made with wicking yarns. Truly versatile, its performance easily transitions from run to hike. The fit maximizes airflow, merrow stitched seams minimize chafing, and a lasting DAO finish helps minimize odour retention.",
