  "description": "Argo WP is a comfortable and safe hiking shoe, perfect for a pleasant outing in the woods or for safe walking on mountain trails. Thanks to its special construction, the Argo WP guarantees excellent anatomical stability. The soft waterproof suede and fabric upper comfortably accommodates the foot, while the breathable mesh lining facilitates optimal climatic comfort inside the shoe. <br><br>To effectively protect the inside from the weather, Trezeta has developed the Trezeta Water Stopper technology, a membrane that prevents external elements from penetrating the shoe. Dry and always protected foot: the double density EVA midsole cushions the support to reduce impacts on the ground, minimize vibrations and accompany the step. Argo WP is a simple but quality shoe, thanks also to the Vibram\u00ae Multiland outsole that ensures maximum adaptability to the ground. The tread has a large contact zone at the front to improve grip on the ground and the multitraction blocks ensure excellent grip on all types of terrain.Dry and always protected foot: the double density EVA midsole cushions the support to reduce impacts on the ground, minimize vibrations and accompany the step.
