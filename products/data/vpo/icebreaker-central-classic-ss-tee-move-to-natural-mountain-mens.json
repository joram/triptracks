  "description": "The Central Classic Short Sleeve Tee Move to Natural Mountain is an ultra-comfy everyday tee featuring original artwork and made from a blend of soft organic cotton and breathable, odor-resistant merino wool. Forward set shoulder seams reduce friction when you\u2019re wearing a pack, and the original graphic artwork features a unique mountain sunrise with the icebreaker mantra.  \n\nInspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
