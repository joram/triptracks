  "description": "When the weather turns, you keep running. Built for trail runs but versatile enough for cross-country ski tours and winter hikes, the Trino SL Tight is superlight, soft, durable, and provides late season protection and comfort. The Gore-Tex Infinium\u2122 fabric is completely windproof, highly breathable, and resists light rain and snow. Teslin\u2122 panels on the calves improve ventilation, articulated patterning elevates freedom, and low-profile hip pockets hold small essentials.",
