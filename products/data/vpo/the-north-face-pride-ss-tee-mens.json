  "description": "Exploration is at the forefront of everything they do at The North Face \u00ae. But whether you\u2019ve reached the top of the mountain or are just beginning your journey, they know that we find strength and success when we all work together to achieve our goals. That\u2019s why they created the Pride Collection to help shine a light on the love, strength and passion of the people in the LGBTQIA+ community. <br><br>The Logowear in this collection is made with a 50/50 recycled cotton/polyester blend and features beautiful and vibrant high-density, water-based, screen-printed graphics that represent the energy and passion of the LGBTQIA+ community. The collection also includes several styles and products from&nbsp;their Accessories, Equipment and Off Mountain lines as well. <br><br>The Pride Collection shows their support for the LGBTQIA+ community during Pride Month and beyond. This collection says we can be who we are and reach the summit no matter what mountain we\u2019re trying to climb.",
