  "description": "The Equinox Shorts might just be the best looking outdoor bottoms you can find. Their lightweight, quick-drying fabric is loaded with stretch for long days on the trail, at the crag, or jet setting from planes to trains and everywhere in between. UPF 50+ sun protection shields your skin from the sun, and a water-resistant DWR finish deflects rain, so no weather forecast will keep you inside. Plus, the slimmed-down style will make you look and feel ready to tackle whatever objective lies on your horizon.",
