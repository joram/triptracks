  "description": "Frigid temperatures won\u2019t stop you from getting your turns. Designed for cold days in-bounds, the Macai delivers serious warmth and weather protection with a refined look. Insulated with RDS-certified European goose down, it keeps you comfortable - even during freezing lift rides - while breathable Gore-Tex sheds wind, rain, snow. The insulated DropHood\u2122 can be removed on clear days, and mesh-backed PowderGuard\u2122 vents let out excess heat without letting snow in.",
