  "description": "For more sustainability in climbing: Our 170 MERINO COOL line combines three natural fibers to create a functional fabric with the perfect properties for summer climbing tours on high, rugged rock faces.<br><br>Fine Tasmanian merino wool is comfortably soft on the skin and naturally temperature- and moisture-regulating. Tencel\u2122 lyocell cellulose fibers provide a pleasant cooling effect thanks to their flat surface and high evaporative coolness. Support comes from sustainably grown hemp, which is known for its tensile strength and elasticity, and makes the 170 MERINO COOL a 100% natural product line. Hemp is particularly environmentally friendly as it needs 80% less water than cotton and can be grown completely without pesticides and herbicides.<br><br>The 170 COOL VERTICAL T-SHIRT for men has a casual cut to guarantee optimum freedom of movement for athletic climbing moves. Its asymmetrical design and natural colors give it a stylishly subtle look that will leave a lasting impression even away from craggy rocks.",
