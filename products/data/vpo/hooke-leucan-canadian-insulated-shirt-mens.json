The shirt is enhanced with reinforced forearms to ensure longevity. Snaps on the cuffs allow you to adjust them as needed and a hidden accessory loop in one of the two chest pockets allows you to hang anything.<br><br>With two handwarmer pockets at the waist and an inside pocket, the Canadian shirt has its practicality while keeping its style. Whether it's to keep you warm while chopping wood, or to look good at the lodge, it's definitely a piece that can follow you for a lifetime!<br><br>All profits from the sale of the Force of Nature shirt will be donated to Leucan. The money raised will be used to finance the socio-recreational activities offered by the organization to children with cancer and their families, including the R\u00e9pit Leucan, which has been held at S\u00e9paq's Station Duchesnay for over 10 years.",
