  "description": "Put on the same sock that pro freeskier Angel Collinson wears with her signature sock, the PhD\u00ae Pro Freeski. Using Collinson's insight, they built these socks with their Indestructawool\u2122 technology for enhanced durability, their 4 Degree\u2122 elite fit system for a dialed, performance-oriented fit, and their Shred Shield\u2122 technology for reduced wear from toes. Its design includes contoured shin and ankle cushioning with a flat knit toe box, as well as a wider welt for a secure fit and comfort. You won't get to Angel's level of skill without practice, but putting on the same sock that she chooses to wear is a good place to start.",
