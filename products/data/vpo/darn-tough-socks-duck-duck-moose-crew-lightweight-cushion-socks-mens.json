  "description": "If you've ever crossed paths with a moose- you'd remember. Our Duck Duck Moose sock comes from a Vermont take on the classic duck-duck-goose game. Only in our version, if you see a moose you run away, not in a circle. Thankfully, the Merino Wool knit and durable construction of these best fitting socks will have you outrunning moose most of the time. Classic crew height of a men's dress sock with cushion under foot for added waddling comfort.",
