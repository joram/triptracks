  "description": "No matter how long the tour and how high the summit, the robust Hike Classic Mid Socks for men do it all. This is ensured by the combination of fine merino wool on the inside and recycled polyamide on the outside, which bring their advantages in the right places. On the outside, the synthetic fiber protects against abrasion from the shoe, while the fine merino wool on the inside regulates temperature and moisture and ensures a comfortable foot climate. Thanks to the comfort cuff and optimized right-left fit, the Hike Classic Mid Socks sit friction-free even on long tours. The padded heel and toe area brings additional comfort and provides pleasant cushioning. All this makes the Hike Classic Mid Socks for men a faithful and indestructible companion on long and intensive mountain tours.",
