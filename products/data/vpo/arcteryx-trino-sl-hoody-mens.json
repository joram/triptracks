  "description": "Wind, light snow, cold drizzle \u2013 you love to be out there no matter the conditions. Built for trail runs but able to handle a wide range of high output activities, the Trino SL Hoody is superlight, highly breathable, and created to handle damp, windy, late season weather. Made from Gore-Tex Infinium\u2122, it blocks wind, breathes exceptionally well, and repels light rain and snow. A knit backer adds some warmth, Teslin\u2122 underarm panels improve ventilation, and the low-profile hood adds protection.",
