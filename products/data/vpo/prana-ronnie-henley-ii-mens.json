  "description": "What's the number one thing you look for in a daily layer? Comfort, right? Good news: this long sleeve layer for men is all about the feel-good factor. Made from soft and responsible organic cotton, it feels great on your skin under a sweater or jacket.<br><br>But it also looks sweet if you are wearing it solo, thanks to the button front placket and seam detailing. And the heathered look adds a little dimension that takes it up a notch from your regular long sleeve layer.",
