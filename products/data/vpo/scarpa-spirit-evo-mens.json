  "description": "The more street-savvy cousin to their Gecko approach shoe, the eco-friendly Spirit is at home on the streets and cobblestones of their favorite towns and metro areas around the world. The recycled and organic cotton upper features a lace-to-toe closure system that is super adaptable, whether you want to cinch it down for a quick buildering session or back it off for more casual use at the brewpub. The midsole provides a well-cushioned ride, and the SuperGum eco outsole has been engineered to stand strong against street or slab.",
