  "description": "Lightweight and breathable, Alpha Knit GTX is a high-performance and versatile shoe, designed for light and fast hiking, even on mixed and demanding terrain. The contemporary design of the upper is constructed using the modern knitted technique, which boasts a superior degree of breathability and lightness. <br><br>The foot is cradled perfectly, thanks also to the soft, asymmetric tongue that respects the natural contours of your foot. But the true innovation is in the coating that employs a new technology: the Gore-Tex Invisible Fit membrane. Direct lamination of the membrane on the upper ensures all creases and wrinkles are eliminated, thus reducing pressure points and ensuring a perfect forefoot fit. <br><br>This special membrane helps to reduce shoe weight, and decrease water absorption and drying times. Alpha Knit GTX provides full protection in challenging weather conditions and a superbly dialled-in fit. Their innovative Smart Lacing System comprises two functions: quick lacing with integrated lace locks and external hooks, which ensures a perfect fit straight from the box and quick and easy adjustment when you\u2019re out on the hills. <br><br>Your personalised lacing even stays dialled in after you take the shoes off. The EVA midsole guarantees maximum lightness, stability and impact absorption. The Vibram\u00ae Multiverse sole features a specific design for mixed terrain types, with high-performance tread pattern for technical approaches, with maximum grip on the heel and a full toe area to provide enhanced safety when scrambling.",
