  "description": "The Seil product line is made of a Merino/Tencel yarn, knitted in  dyed stripes. TENCEL is branded lyocell and modal fiber that is produced by environmentally responsible processes from the sustainably sourced natural raw material wood. Mixed with fine Merino, it makes the fiber stronger, while maintaining the breathability of wool. This is a quality we have tested for a few seasons now, so it is a keeper for sure. We have made some classic stripes in single jersey, in some of our favorite shapes. The Seil Long Sleeve shirt is a timeless piece that looks great with the Lista pants. Just pick your favorite stripe!",
