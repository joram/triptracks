  "description": "Traditional fit with the addition of a tapered leg for a modern silhouette. Duers signature performance denim is interwoven with hip-to-toe fleece for warmth without the bulk of a lined denim. Duers signature gusset and stretch denim in combination with breathable fleece ensures all-day comfort. Finished with a water-repelling DWR treatment. <br><br>Cold weather approved, Duers Fireside Performance Denim is your new winter staple. Thanks to an evolutionary approach of interweaving fabrics rather than gluing them together, this cold weather jean is lined with an ultra-light fleece lining to keep you warm all day long. With the same great features you know and love, like a silver treatment for odor-neutralization, this denim is ready for whatever mother nature has in store.",
