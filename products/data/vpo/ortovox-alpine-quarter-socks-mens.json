  "description": "Summer, sun, sunshine - on long mountain tours in summer temperatures, the Alpine Quarter Socks for men can't be missed. The robust material mix with climate-regulating and odor-inhibiting merino wool is equipped with a circumferential mesh system, which ensures optimal ventilation. So that the foot is not only well ventilated, but also protected in the best possible way, material reinforcements in sensitive areas provide additional cushioning and protect against abrasion. Thanks to comfort waistband, ergonomic right / left fit and a special stabilization zone around the ankle, annoying slipping of the socks is a thing of the past. The soft and supple material prevents wrinkles and, together with the flat seams, prevents unpleasant blisters and pressure points. This makes the Alpine Quarter Socks the perfect companion for extended hikes on hot summer days.",
