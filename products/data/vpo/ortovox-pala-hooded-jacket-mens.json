  "description": "The massive, bizarre towers of the pala group protrude from the stony alpine plateau. Climbing here in the southernmost mountain range of the dolomites takes strong nerves - and strong material. Their merino shield tec line was designed especially for long, alpine routes like these!<br><br>The extremely scuff-resistant outer material of the pala hooded jacket for men achieves more than 50,000 abrasion cycles in the martindale test, which is used to measure scuff resistance. Reinforcements in particularly high-stress areas such as the hips, shoulders and underarms offer maximum protection against craggy rocks. The 4-way stretch material provides full freedom of movement, enhanced by an athletic cut and anatomically shaped elbow areas. Thanks to its no-membrane construction, the pala hooded jacket for men is particularly breathable, while fine merino wool inside&nbsp;offer additional comfort.<br><br>The self-adjusting hood fits under a climbing helmet and the cuffs and waistband are elastic and comfortable. Thanks to its high-reach performance fit, the pala hooded jacket for men adapts to every movement and is perfectly tailored to climbing. The breast pocket and two harness- and backpack-optimized front pockets provide space for small items that you might need to grab quickly on a long day of climbing.<br><br>For the sake of the environment, the entire merino shield tec line is also completely pfc-free and climate-neutral through carbon offsetting. With its fresh look, the pala hooded jacket for men is just right for big climbing routes on high rock faces.",
