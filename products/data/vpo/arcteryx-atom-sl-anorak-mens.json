  "description": "Warm weather is never a constant, even in summer. Superlight and packable \u2013 it stuffs into its chest pocket \u2013 the Atom SL Anorak hits that zone where insulation is required, but in an amount that suits milder conditions. Strategically placed at the chest and back, the Coreloft\u2122 insulation is efficient, light, and compressible. The Tyono\u2122 20 outer balances airflow with wind resistance, a DWR finish repels moisture, stretch fleece side panels ventilate, and an uninsulated hood adds coverage.",
