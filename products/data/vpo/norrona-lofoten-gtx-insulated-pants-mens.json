  "description": "The lofoten Gore-Tex insulated Pants are partly insulated and highly weather protective pants made for freeride adventures on cold days. With these softer and warmer pants, you are all set for new lines in maximum comfort without sacrificing functionality and durability. <br><br>The design is a replica of the iconic lofoten Gore-Tex Pro Pants in a 2-layer construction and has kept essential features such as spacious thigh pockets, reinforcement at the legs to prevent damage from steel edges and the Custom-Fit waist system for optimal customization. <br><br>The extremely durable 2-layer GORE-TEX\u00ae face fabric is recycled and CO DWR treated and the insulation is recycled Thermo40. To keep the weight down and functionality up, the front insulation runs from the top of the thigh and all the way down to the boot and the back insulation is mainly in the seat.",
