  "description": "Those who tackle challenging terrain at a sporty pace on their mountain tours will find a faithful companion in the Ladiz Hybrid Jacket for men: a no frills jacket that is still highly functional. The athletically cut hybrid jacket combines the best of two worlds: on the one hand, it's breathable, packs down small and is so light you barely feel it when you wear it. On the other hand, the soft, breathable merino fleece light grid material with waffle structure on the inside provides warmth whenever you need it. On the front and thus in the body core area, on the shoulders and the hood, windproof tec-stretch material is processed, which optimally follows every movement and reliably blocks headwinds. Thanks to its high functionality, the Ladiz Hybrid jacket for men is versatile on the mountain and in the valley - as a thin insulating mid-layer as well as a protective outer layer.",
