  "description": "Devold\u00ae Kvitegga is developed for cold and harsh weather conditions, and activities with lower intensity and a greater need for insulation. This is one of our warmest and thickest base layers, in 100% merino wool in jacquard knit, with the wool's microscopic air pockets providing optimal heat storage. <br><br>Kvitegga is designed to achieve our goal of reduced consumption and can therefore be used on both sides: Reverse it for a whole new look! The two in one function gives you the option to pack smart, to reduce weight and number of washes. The two-in-one reversible baselayer. Two different designs in one.",
