  "description": "As a trail runner and artist, Travis Weller is an understudy of nature\u2019s perennial drama as a passerby. Color and movement intersect \u201cout far\u201d from the order we call routine, somewhere between freedom and chaos. This collaboration celebrates our inevitable dance with the environment as we move through it.<br><br>The Serrano 8\u201d short is the longest and most relaxed short in the line. Designed with an athletic and functional intent, the short is also just as functionally built for a run to the coffee shop.<br>Constructed from a lightweight Repreve\u00ae recycled polyester 4-way stretch, the fabric is finished with a DWR to enhance the short with a water-resistant finish. Repreve\u00ae is a market leader in recycling used water bottles into fibers to renew into fabrics. Unlined and lightweight, the short is an elastic waist style which is stabilized by an interior jacquarded elastic with a drawstring. Front slash pockets and a side zip pocket are all lined with mesh to encourage breathability and drainage if the short does end up in the water. The back patch pocket is meant to keep your good secure with the YKK zip closure.<br>From the trail to the coffee shop, the Serrano is the everyday and every event short we come to live in.",
