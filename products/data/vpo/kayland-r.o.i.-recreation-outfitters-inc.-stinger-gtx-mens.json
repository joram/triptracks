It\u2019s made of mesh with stitching-free polyurethane panels: breathability and durability with a unique style.<br><br>The lining is in Gore-Tex Extended Comfort, a high-performance membrane famed for providing a range of outstanding properties. Providing breathability and waterproofness in perfect balance, it keeps your feet dry and protected, thanks to a system designed to provide maximum climatic comfort. The membrane is specifically designed for moderate or warm-weather conditions and for intense physical activities.

The system allows you to create a comfortable fit straight from the box and provides easy, fast adjustment when you\u2019re out on the hills. Your personalised lacing even stays dialled in after you take the shoes off.<br><br>A superior comfort fit is assured thanks to specific features: the exclusive Ankle Lock System ensures supportive and precise closure around the ankle whilst at the same time facilitating its natural movement. The resulting sensation is of a perfect symbiosis between your foot and the shoe. The soft padding around the ankle bone further enhances comfort and reinforces the structure without adding extra weight.<br><br>The lacing and tongue are asymmetrical to respect your foot\u2019s natural shape and to provide a superbly snug fit that almost feels like a glove.<br><br>The outsole features the exclusive Vibram\u00ae Multiverse sole, specifically engineered for mixed terrain types even with heavy loads: the excellent midsole cushioning absorbs shocks and protects your joints.
