  "description": "Clothing designed for multiple areas of use is sustainable design. The Utladalen Merino Tee combines design and function and is suitable both for demanding trips in the mountains and for everyday use. As the Utladalen Merino Tee is made from a combination of merino wool and the natural material Tencel, it is temperature-regulating, moisture-transporting, has a cooling effect in the heat and keeps you warm when it is cold. Super soft, light and comfortable.",
