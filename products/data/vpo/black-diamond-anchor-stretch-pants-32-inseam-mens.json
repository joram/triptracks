  "description": "Built for climbers by climbers, the Anchor Pant is tailor-made to handle drop-knees, stems, and crux knee-bars day after day, session after session, thanks to an ultra-durable cotton/nylon stretch fabric. The Anchor Pant\u2019s DWR finish will resist absorption if you\u2019re caught in the rain, and an integrated adjustable waist belt gives you a dialed fit. The harness compatible two front pockets remain sleek and low-pro until you need to use them, while a rear and zippered thigh pocket store a wallet and on-route essentials.",
