  "description": "Sun shines, and you head for the crags. Rainy days \u2013 or a quick climb after work \u2013 means a trip to the gym. However and whatever you\u2019re climbing, these are the shorts that keep you moving. Cool, comfortable, and hardwearing, our lightweight Konseal is made with Fortius\u2122 Air 50, a nylon plain wave that stretches for freedom on the rock and approach. The belt design secures the fit and rides comfortably under a harness, and multiple pockets include an easy-access zippered one at the thigh.",
