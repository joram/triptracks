Stay dry with its waterproof/breathable Marmot MemBrain\u00ae 2-layer fabric, which is fully taped to prevent leaks. If you work up a sweat, heat-releasing PitZips cool you down. Features like a helmet-compatible hood, fixed powder skirt, water-resistant zipper, and VELCRO\u00ae wrist cuffs offer extra weather protection. Stow ski gear in one of the secure pockets.",
