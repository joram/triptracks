  "description": "As a trail runner and artist, Travis Weller is an understudy of nature\u2019s perennial drama as a passerby. Color and movement intersect \u201cout far\u201d from the order we call routine, somewhere between freedom and chaos. This collaboration celebrates our inevitable dance with the environment as we move through it.<br><br>The Mathis short sleeve is designed to deliver the performance required out on the trails while maintaining the styling expected of your favorite graphic t-shirt. It's constructed from a lightweight DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit. DriRelease\u00ae promises to help regulate skin temperature with its moisture wicking yarn construction. The fabric is also fast drying, typically 4x faster than a typical cotton tee. The style is designed with a slim premium fit and features our interior neckline climbing cord hanger loop and Run Amok branding including an interior heat transfer to eliminate any discomfort. Because of the high quality of our DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit, the shirt is supremely comfortable with its soft &amp; natural feel and is easy to care for while maintaining its shape.",
