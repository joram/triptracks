  "description": "Hook\u00e9 was born a little over 10 years ago on the banks of the Restigouche River. Several years later, our mission to protect the Atlantic salmon and the rivers that shelter it is still as present as ever. Hence the importance of transposing it into our new Spring Summer 2023 collection.<br><br>The front illustration of the shirt was designed by our loyal collaborator and artist, Dan Sheridan. The crewneck on the river will quickly become a wardrobe essential: simple and timeless, it's a basic that can be worn with both our off-road and work pants. Made of 100% organic cotton its comfort is matched only by its softness.",
