  "description": "When the temperatures drop, the Rush Polar GTX steps it up to keep you comfortable in the snow and cold. An extended ankle collar height, and a suede upper backed by GORE-TEX\u00ae Insulated Comfort technology and Primaloft\u00ae Gold Eco insulation ensure your feet stay toasty warm on winter hikes or snowshoeing trips. Underfoot support, protection and traction come courtesy of the exclusive PRESA\u00ae outsole with Interactive Kinetic System (IKS) Technology. <br><br>The IKS system features impact absorbing internal domes placed in key ground contact areas that function as mechanical shock absorbers, while our H-compound rubber provides secure grip at low temperatures. The Dynamic Stabilizer Torsion frame supports the arch and wraps the heel on both sides, providing terrific rearfoot stability and torsion control so you can confidently tackle whatever winter mission you have in mind.",
