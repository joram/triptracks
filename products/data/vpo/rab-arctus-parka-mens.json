  "description": "Developed with input from Arctic explorers and the people who live and work in the Polar regions, the Arctus is a do-it-all jacket, loaded with our toughest construction and our hallmark insulation expertise. Built for those stationed at remote outposts, living in cold climates, or exploring extremely cold environments, the Arctus Parka\u2019s features are designed to help you operate more easily. Large patch pockets offer fuss-free storage and an insulated chest pocket for gadgets or snacks. Oversize zip pullers are easy to grab when wearing bulky gloves, aluminium D-rings can be attached to a skidoo kill switch, and a ventilated chin guard allows you to breathe easily without exposing skin or fogging goggles.<br><br>Built with a tough, ripstop outer the Arctus protects you from wind, sleet, and snow. Simple construction tweaks maintain performance but make it easier to repair in remote environments; the waterproof membrane is separate from outer and inner fabrics and is unattached to zips making for straightforward patch-ups if necessary, and drawcords are not sewn in for easy replacement.",
