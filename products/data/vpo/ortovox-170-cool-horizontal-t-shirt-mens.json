  "description": "A perfect trio: Their 170 merino cool line combines three natural fibers to create a functional fabric with the perfect properties for summer climbing tours on high, rugged rock faces. Fine tasmanian merino wool certified in accordance with the Ortovox wool promise is comfortable and soft on the skin and naturally temperature- and moisture-regulating, while the cellulose fiber Tencel\u2122 lyocell provides a cooling effect thanks to its flat surface. Support comes from sustainably grown hemp, which is known for its tensile strength and elasticity, and makes the 170 merino cool a 100% natural product line. Hemp is particularly environmentally friendly as it needs 80% less water than cotton and can be grown completely without pesticides and herbicides. With its casual fit for optimum freedom of movement, the 170 merino cool line looks great too: Its asymmetrical lines make a lasting impression even away from ragged rock.",
