The Remige Hoody is specifically created to help keep climbers, hikers, and anyone seeking mountain adventure shielded from the sun while wicking away moisture on hot days. Exceptionally comfortable next to the skin and designed for freedom of movement, it features a brimmed hood to protect the face, thumb loops to hold sleeves in place, and low-profile seams for comfort under a pack.",
