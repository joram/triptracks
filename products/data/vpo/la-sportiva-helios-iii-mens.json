  "description": "As the third-generation re-design on the ever-popular Helios, the Helios III offers everything you need in an ultralight and perfectly cushioned trail shoe. We added additional tongue and ankle padding for more comfort on longer runs. A combination of rip-stop nylon and mono-burr inserts enable optimal breathability but also abrasion resistance. The low profile, thermo formed toe cap provides protection while the Frixion \u00ae AT 2.0 rubber outsole is long lasting and remarkably versatile.",
