  "description": "The Casale pants are developed especially for climbing, with high-quality materials, an ergonomic fit, and functional details. The casual cord fabric with sustainably grown Hemp and organic cotton is especially comfortable, while elastane ensures full freedom of movement. The natural properties of hemp are particularly suited to climbing, as it is tear-resistant and long-lasting. The Casale pants are also equipped with elastic, extremely scuff-resistant merino shield tec material in especially high-stress areas, while fine merino wool on the inside ensures a good microclimate. Thanks to the ergonomic fit and a fabric insert in the crotch, the robust climbing pants also join in with every athletic movement. <br><br>And as they do, the higher cut of the elastic waistband means that, even under a climbing harness, the back area always remains well covered. The concealed zipper pocket on the thigh is positioned so that it\u2019s always easy to access, even with a climbing harness. The Casale pants always make a great visual impression, too, thanks to neon inserts and a casual fit. <br>&nbsp;",
