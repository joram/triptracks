  "description": "Built for climbers by climbers, the Anchor Short is tailor-made to handle day-in, day-out cragging sessions from Yosemite Valley to the Shawangunks, thanks to an ultra-durable cotton/nylon stretch fabric. The Anchor Short\u2019s DWR finish will resist absorption if you\u2019re caught in the rain, and an integrated adjustable waistbelt gives you a dialed fit. The harness compatible two front pockets remain sleek and low-pro until you need to use them, while a rear pocket stores a wallet for post-send celebrations.",
