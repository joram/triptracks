  "description": "Whether ski touring, mountaineering or hiking, this jacket has a single mission: to maximize warmth and minimize weight. The incredible warmth-to-weight ratio is owing to the combination of ultralight, abrasion-resistant ripstop nylon and goose down with 900&nbsp;cuin fill power. Synthetic filling is cleverly placed in spots requiring extra reinforcement, keeping you warm even in damp conditions. Wear this versatile insulated jacket as a warm mid-layer or outer layer in cold, dry conditions. It packs down small and weighs almost nothing at all. So there\u2019s no excuse \u2013 whenever you plan on heading into the mountains, never forget to pack the Taiss IN Hooded Jacket.",
