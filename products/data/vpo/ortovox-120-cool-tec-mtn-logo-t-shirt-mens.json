  "description": "Athletic mountain activities despite the heat: the 120 cool tec mtn logo ts for men makes this possible and completes our line of cooling clothing for warm days.&nbsp; the 120 cool tec mtn logo t-shirt embodies pure functionality, because the combination of fine merino fibers and botanical tencel\u00ae cellulose fibers is self-cooling, tough and durable thanks to corespun technology. This is due to a complicated process in which the fine merino and tencel(tm) fibers are spun around a core of polyamide filaments. The resulting yarn is used to produce a material that has the same benefits as merino wool and tencel(tm), and is even more robust. With a fiber diameter of just 17.5 microns, the merino wool feels particularly soft on the skin.&nbsp; the 120 cool tec mtn logo ts for men is therefore ideal for athletic mountain activities, especially on hot days.&nbsp;",
