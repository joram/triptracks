  "description": "When you're far beyond tree line and still have a ways to go to the summit, you\u2019ll be glad to have the Men\u2019s Preon Fleece Hoody as your midlayer. Breathable Pontetorto fleece wicks sweat away from skin during tough ascents, plus flatlock seams reduce chafing. When dark skies roll in, the attached hood and chin guard offer extra coverage, while thumbholes make this zip-up hoodie quick to layer under a shell or insulated jacket.",
