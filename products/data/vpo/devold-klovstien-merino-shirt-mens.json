The shirts are knitted in a Wool-Tencel blend with high durability and good elasticity - especially designed for high-intensity biking in the mountain. Choose between a characteristic camouflage pattern or a rough looking m\u00e9lange pattern. The shirts are loose fitted and the Tencel yarn in the jacquard knit, gives the shirts a silky soft and smooth feeling against warm summer skin. The shirts are equipped with a classic round neck and has either short or long sleeves. The shirt with long sleeves will protect the elbows. On the inside of the shirts and t-shirts - marked with a reflective sign on the outside - you find a linen cloth which can be used to dry off dusty biking glasses. The shirts are designed with mesh panels under arms to optimize ventilation. All logos are reflective, with highly visible markings on sleeves. </p>",
