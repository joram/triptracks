  "description": "The Berlin Long Sleeve Shirt is a classic, comfortable, and extremely versatile button-up shirt for everyday casual style. Made from a soft and breathable woven twill that blends merino wool and organic cotton, this shirt also features forward-set shoulder seams, a double-layer back yoke, and natural Corozo buttons. Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics. Merino is an annually renewable fiber that naturally resists odors, keeps you cool when it\u2019s hot and warm when it\u2019s not, and lets your skin breathe for comfort all day, every day.",
