  "description": "Arcteryx's lightest climbing hardshell delivers proven Gore-Tex protection for just 210g. It is minimalist by design, built for unforgiving alpine conditions, and packable enough to take anywhere. The 3L Gore-Tex with ultralight, ultra-durable Hadron\u2122 face fabric provides waterproof, windproof, breathable protection. Redefining the standard for superlight alpine durability, Hadron\u2122 is a gridded face fabric engineered with a liquid crystal polymer ripstop. Its innovative design delivers abrasion resistance rivaling fabrics twice its weight. The Alpha\u2019s features include alpine essentials like a helmet-compatible StormHood\u2122 that adjusts for superior peripheral vision and an embedded Recco\u00ae reflector to aid search teams.",
