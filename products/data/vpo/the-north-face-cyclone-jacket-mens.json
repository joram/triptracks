  "description": "When you have no idea what the day has in store, reach for the Cyclone Jacket. The relaxed fit works for everyday wear, while the durable, wind-resistant ripstop fabric means you can take it beyond the city limits, too. The adjustable hood, elasticated cuffs and hem help stop the wind sneaking in. Plus, it's now made from recycled polyester, helping to give discarded plastic a second chance.",
