  "description": "Cotopaxi's most layerable fleece, ever. Take it everywhere: the Lozano keeps chills at bay without the weight. Layer it under a down jacket, throw it on solo for quick warmth, or stow it in your pack just in case. Featuring a shelf waistband and sweatshirt-inspired cuffs, it's made from a recycled polyester and Tencel fabric blend for that cozy, soft-hand feel.",
