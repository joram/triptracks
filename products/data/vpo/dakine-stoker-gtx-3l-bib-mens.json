Water-resistant zippers and taped seams enhance storm protection, while thigh zips add venting for the uptrack. Center-front entry design allows for easy on-and-off. A stretch backpanel complements articulated knees, and a redesigned crotch gives the mobility to match your ambition. Strategically placed pocket options keep all the right stuff exactly where you need it.",
