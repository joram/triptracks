This is one flip that won\u2019t flop, featuring ultra-durable PU construction inspired by our Classic Z/Sandals and a sturdy and capable underfoot feel. Engineered with Chaco\u2019s contoured LUVSEAT\u2122 arch-support that promotes healthy alignment, the corrective footbeds are accepted by the APMA (American Podiatric Medical Association) and feel fantastic whether on the go or recovering after long runs, hikes, and workouts. A favorite of river guides, adventurers, and athletes; enjoyed high-tide, mountainside, and everywhere in-between. Features a jacquard textile upper strap and reinforced toe posts. Vegan.",
