  "description": "Lightweight, soft warmth for cold days hunting \u2013 Lappland Fleece Jacket is a versatile mid layer that is just as suitable for forest life as for the shooting range. Its design is timeless with a high collar, hand pockets and shoulders in G-1000 Silent Eco that can resist wear from backpack straps. Made from recycled polyester with an environmentally friendly method that dyes and spins the yarn at the same time, meaning much less water and energy is used than in traditional dyeing.",
