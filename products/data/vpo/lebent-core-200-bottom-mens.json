  "description": "A fresh look with the same iconic feel, the Core 200 Bottom is a super soft high performance base layer that loves being on skin and won\u2019t irritate the most irritable of skin types thanks to our Signature Blend of Merino Wool and Rayon from Bamboo.<br><br>This layer delivers the added bonus of superior temperature regulation, moisture control and stays odour free far longer than you would think possible. Meaning you can adventure more and wash less. The 200 lightweight bottoms are created with flat seams to prevent chafing, sculpted panels to provide a performance fit and a wide waistband to distribute pressure and ensure a firm, comfortable hold.<br>",
