  "description": "Saltholmen is a product line launched for Summer '22, with great success. We have used our favorite yarn from S\u00fcdwolle, in Super Fine Merino, and added some Creora-Eco-Soft for elasticity. Our classic Breton stripes adds a maritime look to this merino piece, which are perfect for layering when you are boating. As you know, the weather can be quite windy and cold out at sea, even in Summer. So wearing pieces that are breathable under your mid-layer or shell jacket, keeps you warm in the cold wind, but at the same time, it keeps you ventilated when you are wearing it without any layering. Merino wool is perfect for vacationing on boats, where you try to keep your luggage to a minimum. Merino does not have to be washed after each use, just hang it out to be aired and it will feel nice and fresh for the next time you want to wear it. The striped polo shirt is a great piece for your Summer wardrobe, and with Merino functionalliity added, it is going to be your favorite.",
