  "description": "Soft shell pants for performance-oriented ski tours. The highly elastic double fabric has been DWR treated and so offers long-lasting wind and water-repellent behavior. Stretch inserts on the thighs and in the crotch area provide good ventilation and generous freedom of movement. The Aenergy Pants also have side ventilation. Naturally, features specific to ski touring are also included, such as edge and crampon protection as well as adjustable leg hems.",
