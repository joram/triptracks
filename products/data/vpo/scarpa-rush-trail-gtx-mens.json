  "description": "Take your hike beyond the ordinary with the Rush Trail GTX, our latest extension of the super-popular Rush family. The Rush Trail GTX offers the same traction and support of the Rush TRK GTX, in a low-cut, more nimble package. The suede upper balances the light and agile feel of a trail running shoe with the support and protection you expect from a hiking boot. Underfoot support, protection and traction come courtesy of the exclusive PRESA\u00ae outsole with IKS impact absorbing internal domes placed in key ground contact areas that function as mechanical shock absorbers, while our SuperGum rubber compound provides secure grip on whatever terrain you encounter. The DST frame supports the arch and wraps the heel on both sides, providing terrific rearfoot stability and torsion control so you can confidently tackle whatever the trail has in store.",
