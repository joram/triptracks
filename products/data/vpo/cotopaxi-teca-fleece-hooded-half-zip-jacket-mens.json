  "description": "What dreams are made of. Sustainable, super cozy, and bright as can be, the Teca Fleece is the cold-weather cousin of our Teca Windbreaker. This iteration adds a hood and shortens the zipper length, for even more cozy, camp-inspired style. Great as a stand-alone jacket or midlayer, each Teca Fleece is made from best-in-class, recycled fleece and DWR-treated, polyester taffeta left over from other companies\u2019 production runs. <br><br>This keeps perfectly good materials out of the landfill, instead putting them in the hands of thoughtful adventurers like you.",
