  "description": "The Seil product line is made of a Merino/Tencel yarn, knitted in dyed stripes. TENCEL is branded lyocell and modal fiber that is produced by environmentally responsible processes from the sustainably sourced natural raw material wood. Mixed with fine Merino, it makes the fiber stronger, while maintaining the breathability of wool.&nbsp;The Seil Polo shirt has a classic fit, with a hidden buttoning tab, and a small flag label on the sleeve. Wear it with the Lista shorts for a complete look.",
