The high-quality material is lightweight, stretchable and pleasant to wear. An antimicrobial treatment using the chemical-free Livinguard\u00ae technology prevents the formation of unpleasant odors. This makes the Aconcagua Light easy-care, durable and environmentally friendly, as you won't need to wash it as often. The design of the pockets is tailored to the needs of mountain sports enthusiasts: allowing easy access at all times, even when wearing a backpack or climbing harness. A versatile and comfortable mid-layer hooded jacket.",
