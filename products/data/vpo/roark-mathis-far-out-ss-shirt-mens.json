  "description": "Designed by artist, trail runner and Run Amok family Travis Weller, the Far Out, Out Far collection is his personal take on camouflage.<br><br>\u201cCamo can be a lot of different things - all animals use it in some manner as a protection agency, and for me, running is a camouflage of how I\u2019m feeling\u2026 it transforms my thoughts and emotions into something more palatable and sensible.\u201d - TS Weller<br><br>The Mathis short sleeve is designed to deliver the performance required out on the trails while maintaining the styling expected of your favorite graphic t-shirt. It's constructed from a lightweight DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit. DriRelease\u00ae promises to help regulate skin temperature with its moisture wicking yarn construction. The fabric is also fast drying, typically 4x faster than a typical cotton tee. The style is designed with a slim premium fit and features our interior neckline climbing cord hanger loop and Run Amok branding including an interior heat transfer to eliminate any discomfort. Because of the high quality of our DriRelease\u00ae jersey knit, the shirt is supremely comfortable with its soft &amp; natural feel and is easy to care for while maintaining its shape.",
