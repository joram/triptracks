  "description": "This updated version of their classic MTN Trainer is designed in Montebelluna, the small town at the foothills of the Dolomites famous for mountain footwear. It\u2019s a robust, versatile low-cut alpine approach shoe with a 1.6-millimetre suede upper and a Vibram outsole made for prolonged heavy use. The hard-wearing leather upper has a full protective rubber rand for 360\u00b0 abrasion resistance in rocky terrain and a breathable mesh lining. The improved lasted construction ensures a comfortable and more flexible fit, while the medium-stiff nylon midsole is supportive at the midfoot, but still allows good flex at the forefoot for moving faster in rough terrain. The multifunctional Vibram MTN Trainer Evo outsole has deep, self-cleaning grooves and aggressive lugs that guarantee good grip on rock and scree and optimal traction on mud and grass. A special via ferrata zone under the midfoot, before the heel, has special right-angled lugs for better grip on the iron rungs of via ferrata ladders. Their signature 3F system connects the instep area with the sole and heel for flexibility, correct fit and support. The climbing lacing system can be fine-tuned at the toe for greater climbing precision, while the stretch gaiter under the laces offers additional weather protection. And the cushioning OrthoLite footbed wicks away moisture to keep your feet cool. The men\u2019s MTN Trainer 2 is a comfortable alpine approach solution for technical hikes, via ferratas and treks.",
