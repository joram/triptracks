  "description": "Technical mountaineering gets a new level of comfort, through the skilful use of layers.\nStellar GTX is a nimble, crampon-compatible boot for high altitude mountaineering, as well as speed ascents on rock, mixed, snow and ice, and climbing.\nIts secret is the new construction technique used for the sole unit: the foot sits directly on top of the soft PU midsole to maximize cushioning and ensure precise foot placement, as well as providing impact resistance on rough terrain. The precision and technical features of this mountaineering boot are further enhanced by a feel which is more akin to a trail shoe: the snug fit and anatomical lasting make them a pleasure to wear. Stellar GTX is an innovative shoe offering outstanding comfort that marks the continuing evolution of Kayland's mountaineering DNA: a classic approach to the mountains, where the pleasure of the experience is as important as performance. Boot height and closure are traditional \u2013 a touch purists will appreciate \u2013 while the feel of the fit is totally new.",
