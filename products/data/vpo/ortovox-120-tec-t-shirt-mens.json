  "description": "The alpine summer is calling! With new mountain prints, the t-shirts from the 120 merino tec line are ready for rugged summits and steep rock faces. The tried-and-tested yarn construction continues to guarantee the necessary stability and scuff protection: The material is extremely lightweight and at the same time very durable thanks to the corespun technology by the \u00a9 S\u00fcdwolle Group. In this spinning process, soft Tasmanian merino fibers with a fiber diameter of 17.5 microns are spun around a core of polyamide filaments. This creates a yarn that can be used to produce materials that are thin, lightweight and elastic, yet extremely robust and sturdy at the same time. In addition, the Tasmanian wool creates a proven microclimate and wear comfort.",
