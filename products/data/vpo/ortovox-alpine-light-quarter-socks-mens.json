  "description": "Those who like to be fast and long on the mountain in summer will love the Alpine Light Quarter Socks for men! \n\nThe already climate-regulating and odor-resistant merino wool is equipped with a circumferential mesh system, which ensures optimal ventilation even in sweaty climbs. So that the foot is not only well ventilated, but also protected in the best possible way, material reinforcements in the heel and toe area provide additional cushioning and protect against abrasion. Thanks to elastic double waistband, ergonomic right / left fit and a special stabilization zone around the ankle, annoying slipping of the socks is a thing of the past. The lightweight, soft and supple material prevents wrinkles and, together with the flat seams, prevents unpleasant blisters and pressure points.\n\nThis makes the ALPINE LIGHT QUARTER SOCKS for men the perfect companion for extended hikes on hot summer days.",
