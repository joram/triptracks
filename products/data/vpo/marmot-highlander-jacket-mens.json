  "description": "Forecast calling for cold? Time to get after it in the Highlander Jacket. This classic down puffer layers nicely under a waterproof shell to comfortably relieve you on shivering chairlift rides, and its timeless look and vintage feel fits perfectly overtop any cold-weather outfit in your closet. Zip up when the cold gusts kicks in on the midtown train or the gondola to and from the slopes. 700-fill-power down packs tons of heat on and off the mountain and packs down small for easy-stuffing storage when you're on the move.",
