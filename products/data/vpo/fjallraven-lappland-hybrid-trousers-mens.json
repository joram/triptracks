  "description": "Lightweight, hardwearing trousers with optimised fit for active hunting. The design is based on the award-winning Keb Trousers and the trousers are made from stretch fabric for excellent freedom of movement with silent, weather resistant G-1000 Silent Eco on the rear, front of the thighs, over the knees and inside lower legs. An obvious first choice for physically intensive hunting, such as bird stalking that involves bursts of activity in varied terrain, or for when hunting with dogs. <br><br>Ventilation openings with zippers from the knee to the hip release excess heat, and there are also zippers on the outside of the calves. There are two spacious leg pockets, both with flaps and press buttons \u2013 the left hand one also has a zipper and has an inside mesh pocket for a mobile phone or radio. In addition there are two hand pockets and a knife pocket. The seams at the inside of the thighs have been placed to minimise the risk of chafing and the double layer of fabric over the calves can withstand wear and tear from boots. Strap adjustments with buttons secure the leg endings around boots and there is a boothook that can be fastened to laces. Reinforced brace zones allow braces to sit well should you decide to use them. Openings for knee pads (an accessory).",
