  "description": "Introducing the all new Chillos Clog by Chaco. Craving the ease, comfort, and breathability of a casual slip-on, but the protection and versatility to be spontaneous and go where the day brings you? They've got you covered. The Chillos Clogs closed toe and open back gives you the best of both worlds, so you can head out and enjoy those long summer days in a style that's entirely your own. The blown-EVA construction means they float in water and are marshmallow soft underfoot. <br><br>Engineered with Chaco's contoured LUVSEAT arch-support that promotes healthy alignment, the corrective footbeds are accepted by the APMA (American Podiatric Medical Association). Perfect for around campus, summer camp, the gym, spring break, or just hanging around the pool. And best of all they are no fuss. Get `em dirty, rinse `em off and be on your way!",
