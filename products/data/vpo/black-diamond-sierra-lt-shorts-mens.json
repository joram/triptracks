  "description": "Inspired by those immaculate afternoons in the high sierras, pulling on the blocs of Tuolumne and taking a dip in Tenaya Lake after the session, the Sierra LT Shorts are ultralight, and quick drying. With a branded elastic waistband, a Velcro back pocket combined with two front hand pockets, these shorts are minimal, comfy and built for everyday adventures on and off the rock.",
