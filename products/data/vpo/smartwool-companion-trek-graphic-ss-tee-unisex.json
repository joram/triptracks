  "description": "Designed for comfort, with offset shoulder seams, Merino wool for temperature regulation and odor control, and flatlock seams to minimize chafing, our Companion Trek Graphic Short Sleeve Tee also has the quick dry times of recycled polyester, so even as you notch the intensity up, sweat and heat won\u2019t bring you down. So grab this tee and get out there for anything from a day hike to 5K and beyond.<br><br>Although this tee was built on our Men's regular fit design block, it is intended to be a Unisex item. For Men, please order your regular size. For Women, we recommend to size down one size from your standard size. If you prefer an oversized look, then we would recommend ordering your standard Women's size.",
