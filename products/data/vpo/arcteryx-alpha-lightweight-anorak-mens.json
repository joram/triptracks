  "description": "Their lightest climbing hardshell delivers proven GORE-TEX protection for just 210g. It is minimalist by design, built for unforgiving alpine conditions, and packable enough to take anywhere. The 3L GORE-TEX with ultralight, ultra-durable Hadron\u2122 face fabric provides waterproof, windproof, breathable protection. Redefining the standard for superlight alpine durability, Hadron\u2122 is a gridded face fabric engineered with a liquid crystal polymer ripstop. Its innovative design delivers abrasion resistance rivaling fabrics twice its weight. The Alpha\u2019s features include alpine essentials like a helmet-compatible StormHood\u2122 that adjusts for superior peripheral vision and an embedded RECCO\u00ae reflector to aid search teams. \n<p>Updated with a revised fit.</p>\n<p>The Alpha Lightweight Anorak was previously the Alpha SL Anorak.</p>",
