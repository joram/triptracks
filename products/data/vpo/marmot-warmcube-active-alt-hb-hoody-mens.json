  "description": "Meet their lightest, high-performance down jacket to date. The all-new WarmCube\u2122 Active Alt HB Jacket offers warmth when you want it and when you need it. This versatile winter active piece can cover all your heart-racing cold weather adventures layered on the inside or chilling on the outside. Internal temps are regulated by circulating air while you're moving and trapping heat inside down cubes when you stop. What does that mean? You won't overheat on high-altitude, high-pulse hikes when you'd typically be shedding layers, and you'll stay warm even when you're catching your breath in the thick of the backcountry powder. If snow or rain isn't in the forecast, rock the Alt HB standalone as a heat-pumping, ultra-breathable outer option.",
