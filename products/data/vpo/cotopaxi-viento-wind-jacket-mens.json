  "description": "If you needed to take one jacket on a trip, this would be it. Versatile, comfortable, and perfectly stretchy, the Viento was born to explore. In addition to its lightweight protection, this jacket feels great on the skin\u2014its fabric blend of 96% nylon and 4% spandex is soft but athletic: something you could wear on a sky-high adventure or while chilling in a camp chair. A three piece fitted hood and elastic cuffs on the sleeves keep the warmth in, while zippered hand pockets keep your hands comfortable and toasty. And when you\u2019re not using the Viento, pack it into one of its own travel compatible drop-in pockets for easy, on-the-go storage.",
