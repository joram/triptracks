  "description": "Their Faerder collection features 80% brushed merino wool fleece and is named after the Faerder lighthouse, situated at the beginning of the Oslo fjord. This is also where the world's biggest \"over-night\" regatta takes place in June every year, since 1947. It is arranged by the Royal Norwegian Sailing Association. Usually, between 600-700 boats are in the race. A good fleece garment is always a must to bring on a sailboat, and their jacket is made from a lovely, brushed Merino-Fleece. It has a zipper in front, as well as zipped front pockets. The chest pocket in front is made of water repellent fabric and is closed with a zipper.",
