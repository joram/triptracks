  "description": "Your window to climb \u2013 or tour or trek \u2013 should not be closed by unpredictable weather, so we designed the Gamma MX Pant to handle mixed conditions. Lightly insulated, these breathable, stretchy pants resist wind and weather on mixed routes, extended approaches and tours. The Fortius\u2122 2.0 fabric has a superior warmth-to-weight ratio and is exceptionally durable. A gusseted crotch works with the stretch for freedom of movement, and pockets are accessible while wearing a pack or harness.<br><br>Crafted at a Fair Trade Certified facility as part of their commitment to transition 80% of Arc\u2019teryx products to fair trade certification by 2025.",
