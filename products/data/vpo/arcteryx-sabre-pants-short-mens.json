  "description": "With a progressive design that frees you to explore, the Sabre Pant handles every aspect of freeriding \u2013 from big mountain backcountry missions to a day carving up corduroy at the resort. The durable, breathable N80p-X 3L GORE-TEX shuts out sleet, snow, and wind. A flannel backer adds light insulation. Thigh vents dump heat on the uptrack, the focused articulation frees you to move on technical descents, and a RECCO\u00ae reflector\u2019s embedded for added safety.",
