  "description": "Their desire to make the Gaucho Snapshirt is one of the reasons they started Howler Brothers in the first place. They wanted to transform the vintage western shirts of the past into something technical and wearable in everyday life while maintaining a little of their quirky nature and penchant for unique, embroidered artwork. They succeeded in a big way by making theirs out of lightweight, quick drying cotton-poly blend and adding a cooling mesh-lined vented back yoke to keep it cool when the temperatures are cooking. They threw in pleated chest pockets, pearl snaps, and an ever evolving slate of custom embroidery.",
