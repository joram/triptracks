  "description": "Versatile, everyday insulation with a dose of alpine inspiration, the Helix Jacket combines sustainable materials with a technical crossover design that sheds light precipitation. Zoned, quilted panels of 70gm MerinoLoft\u2122 insulation bring warmth to key areas while merino terry side panels regulate body temperature on warmer days. The snug-fitting, insulated hood provides added protection, while zippered hand pockets keep small essentials close at hand.<br><br>Three layers of comfort in a lightweight layer, icebreaker MerinoLoft\u2122 has a durable, water-repellent shell filled with natural merino-fiber batting, with a super-soft lining in 100% merino. Inspired by nature, icebreaker harnesses the performance qualities of natural fibers to offer an alternative to clothing based on petrochemical synthetics.",
