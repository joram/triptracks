  "description": "The Trysil sweaters are memories of the old ski heros of the 50s we see in black and white photos. Nostalgic and feel good pieces made with the most beautiful merino/cashmere yarns from Linsieme and knitted in Italy. This classic crew neck sweater is a beautiful piece knitted in a pearl knit structure, with contrast panels on the sleeve. Wear it over the Sn\u00f8 zip-up in matching color, paired with the classic knickerbocker or your ski pants for the posh alpine look.",
