  "description": "Throwing a pair of the low-ankle Tundra Slip-on Aerogel Booties into your pack turns any snow camping, mountaineering, or backcountry hut trips into a luxurious experience without the extra weight. Each bootie features a compression-resistant PrimaLoft\u00ae Aerogel insert that acts as a thermal barrier between your feet and the elements, as well as a weather resistant exterior shell and grippy print on the sole. VerticalX\u2122 insulation offers a superior warmth-to-weight ratio that works even when wet. A collapsible heel can be worn up, or tucked away to convert booties into slippers.",
