  "description": "Thanks to the fine wool fibers of the Tasmanian merino wool used in the light Fleece line, it is particularly soft and comfortable on the skin. The waffle structure on the inside ensures optimum moisture wicking and therefore feels warm and most importantly dry on the skin \u2013 even after demanding ascents. Thanks to its ergonomic cut and high stretchability, this lightweight fleece jumper will feel like a second skin.<br><br>Fine details make the Fleece Light Zip Neck for men the perfect companion. A two-layer collar protects against wind and cold while a deep zipper opening allows the fleece to be put on and taken off particularly easily. The practical breast pocket has room for small items such as a cell phone or trail bar and can be easily accessed, even when wearing a backpack.<br><br>Whether as underwear or an outer layer: The Fleece Light Zip Neck for men is just as perfect for a ski tour in winter as an alpine tour in summer.",
