  "description": "Traditional rubber boots are made for fishing boats. Sure they\u2019ll keep feet dry, but they\u2019re heavy, clumsy and end up smelling a bit clammy. Dakine's Slush Sports are made for mountains, and are the first waterproof boot built for performance. With a sneaker-like contoured fit and a lightweight cushioned EVA midsole they\u2019ll never slow you down, whether at play or apr\u00e9s.",
